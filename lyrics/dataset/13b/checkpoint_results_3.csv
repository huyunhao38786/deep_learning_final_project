Can you pull the curtains? Let me see the sunshine
I think I'm done with my hidin' place and you found me anyway
It's been forever, but I'm feelin' alright
Tears dry and will leave no trace and tomorrow's another day

[Verse 1]
Hide and seek, I am somewhere closed away
You won't believe how long it's been since I started the game
I can't be seen and you won't find me today
I've not been this low, but I'll be okay

[Pre-Chorus]
""Are you alright?"" Maybe don't ask
'Cause you know I never like to talk about that
Keep it inside, yeah, you say I always hold back
And I always wear long sleeves
Is it in your childhood? Somethin' happen in your past?
Well, the sadness, yeah, I promise that it won't last
And if I could, I would try to take it all back
There's still more underneath and that's when you say to me

[Chorus]
""Can you pull the curtains? Let me see the sunshine
I think I'm done with my hidin' place and you found me anyway
It's been forever, but I'm feelin' alright
Tears dry and will leave no trace and tomorrow's another day""

Hide and seek, count to ten and close your eyes
Try to breathe, see a message and don't reply
Nice to meet, but in reality, say goodbye
Life can be so beautiful if you try

[Pre-Chorus]
""Are you okay?"" Yeah, I guess so
But on some days, I feel like I'm trapped in a hole
But I keep quiet, so the ones around me don't know
That the mountain feels so steep
And I'll say that I'm here to help to carry the load
And the outside rays, they are good for the soul
So, let's step out of the dark 'cause, in here, it's so cold
The day's not out of reach and that's when you say to me

[Chorus]
""Can you pull the curtains? Let me see the sunshine
I think I'm done with my hidin' place and you found me anyway

Uh
I just put, I just put a tonne on the back of a truck (Uh)
Me and Midgy should’ve won the Cannabis Cup
I ain’t put no plaques on my wall yet
By at least five, I’ll send those packs to your doorstep
In this, in this music scene I’m legendary
Raps always been secondary like February
Told my guy, “Don’t come near me with no tester” (Uh)
Don’t be talkin’ packs ‘round Siri and Alexa
Free the gang, I can't forget my celly
I was gettin' letters in the can, like alphabets spaghetti, uh
All these niggas bite my style
I did ""A-Wings Got Talent"" in jail, I was like Simon Cowell
I was in cali 'round the neck like bow tie
K-K-Kush God, bitch, I'm the most high
I see these rappers actin' Holly' (Uh)
When they were out there crowd surfing, we were catchin' bodies (Who were they?)
I ain't a tough guy, I always make everybody laugh
I could spit all my bars wearin' a polygraph
Rap star, still makin' pounds fly
Opps tryna' turn me stray like Ivory from How High
Used to shot ounces
Had a sold out tour, but I still got more fans in my crop houses
I spray up where you're cotchin'
Spent all my money on packs, I was literally weighing up my options
They say their guns spit, they ain't never done shit
Just landed the runtz 'bout to roll up a trumpet, uh
She want a man with P, but that bitch poor
That's why I'm in her crib hiding keys like a jigsaw
Still got food on the curb
I pull up with this half moon, I don't mean do not disturb
Came alone, could've brought an army
If I air it out, forensics will have to pick up more men than Lori Harvey
Came a long way from trappin' in the rain
My chicks a side bitch 'cause I'm married to the game, uh
Me and Budz in Dubai on a jetski
Sold so much coke like I'm rivals with Pepsi
I used to break these packs down into fractions
These niggas do way too much capping in their captions
I'm tryna leave the game but I need a lane (Uh)
These niggas pree the chain, they don't see the pain
They sent me jail for importing weed from Spain
I came home, in six weeks released a strain
Still remember reloading on a Q
We got them jungle boys, it ain't Mowgli and Baloo
The CM wishing they could bring me back
Cah they still need gangsters like me to point their fingers at, uh
Last year I was missing rap
I was on the wing kicking back with my nigga Skrapz
Even though my block's full of pricks, I ain't (Nah)
And I don't trust bitches even if my chick's a saint
Paid for my last campaign, label ain't reimbursed me
Smashed her and never picked up cah she was thirsty
They just started, I was shipping packs time ago
Trading flavours with all the growers outside my show, uh
This ain't happened cause of luck
Fuck your little chain, I spend that shit at Hakkasan on duck
To make it to a kilo, that was the game plan
When I had no 'nect like I was playing Rayman
Used to have a thirty-eight when I was trapping in the snow
Still got it to this day, I even brang it to my show, uh
I can move a hundred keys in less than a week
Driving through the other side like this is Sesame Street (Pussies)
Still the same old me even though I'm rich
And it's still gang gang, I'll never switch

The paraphrase is:
I've been thinking of you

I found that it's a bit confusing.
The original line of lyrics is a complete sentence.
The paraphrase line is not.

In the paraphrase, the line ends with a period.
However, in the original line, there is no period.

I found the line of lyrics and the paraphrase are not grammatically correct.

For the original line of lyrics, the subject is ""I"".
However, the verb ""have been"" is plural.
The verb ""have been"" is a plural verb.
In English, the subject ""I"" is singular.
So, the verb ""have been"" should be singular.
The sentence should be ""I have been thinking of you"".

Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this

Creep Lyrics[Verse 1]
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

[Verse 2]
She runs and hides
Her head's down as her hair falls
Would you please just stop faking?
It's not like I was ever in love with you
It's just that you make me feel like I am
She runs and hides
Her head's down as her hair falls
Would you please just stop faking?
It's not like I was ever in love with you
It's just that you make me feel like I am

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

[Outro]
She don't know where she comes from
Is that me?
Is somebody else?
Is that me?
Is somebody else?

Strange light revolves around you
You float across the room
Your touch is made of something
Heaven can't hold a candle to
You're made of something new
Let's not get complicated
Let's just enjoy the view
It's hard to be a human
So much to put an answer to
But that's just what we do

[Chorus]
God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow out of control
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the same

[Verse 2]
I'm having revelations
You dance across the floor
Beyond infatuation
How I obsessively adore you
That's what I do

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe
I could die in your kiss
No, it doesn't get, doesn't get
Better than this

Sleazin' and teasin', I'm sittin' on him
All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him

[Verse 1: RAYE]
A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'

[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways
You might also like[Chorus: RAYE]
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel

[Verse 2: RAYE]
Toke this joint how I'm blowin' this steam
Back to my ways like 2019
Not twenty-four hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in

[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways
[Chorus: RAYE & 070 Shake]
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel, mm (What?)

[Verse 3: 070 Shake & RAYE]
'Cause I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
Be at peace with the things you can't change (Last night)
I'll be naked when I leave and I was naked when I came, yeah
Out of reach, out of touch
Too numb, I don't feel no way
Toast up, so what?
Street small, but it go both ways
So, you'll run, yeah
But you'll never escape
Sunset in the maze

I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night, oh

I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night

Mm, lipstick smudged like modern art

You call my phone, you're asking for Tuesday
What the fuck is that? Who is Tuesday?
You see, the problem started when my Tuesday bitch wanted a Friday slot
And I gave it to her
Now I got Friday beefing with Thursday
Tuesday's got beef with Wednesday now, it's all mad

[Verse 1]
My Monday chick
Supermodel, always comes through on some runway shit, uh
Got me stalling like my car was in clutch
Probably woulda locked her down, but she parties too much
Tuesday got more breast than Kentucky
Airhead, but she give the best sucky-sucky (Yeah)
Wednesday got a man who plays for Chelsea
Away games, she always FaceTimes me, taking selfies
Thursday's on the 'Gram looking rich and sexy
Got an AP on, but her fridge is empty, uh (If I'm lyin', I'm dyin')
I told Friday what we could've had
But she just wanna take man for a sugar dad (Fuckin' gold digger)
I spend my weekends with the fam
So don't judge me like I'm speaking on the stand
'Cause all my hoes is a ten
And next week, I'll do it all over again

My Taurus chick's way too bossy
My Sagittarius chick's always rolling with a new posse, uh
I only fuck with my Libra chick when I'm high
'Cause she crazy like my chick that's a Gemini (Psycho)
My Aquarius chick never shows me love
My Aries chick just wants to hold a grudge, uh
I love chilling with my Cancer chick
But she got a temper, nearly made me crash my whip (Who you shoutin' at?)
My Virgo chick's forever fussing
And she's a know-it-all, you can't tell her nothing (Uh)
My Leo chick stays by my side

Got these bitches in their feelings like a Pisces

Nino got my back, that's bro, got my back like Vidić (Ayy)

'Cause I don't wanna see you cryin'
I'll ride to the end of the Earth with you

Since the fuckery from my past, I tend to move on quick, I tend to move on good
Seasoned the speed, now I'm over the man who was sleepin' underneath me
Said I couldn't live without you when I loved you
Well, I lied and you shouldn't have believed me
Twenty-four hours in the bed and believe me, it's 'bout to get freaky
Only get to see me when you see me on a phone screen, G
You no longer know me, I no longer want you, you may never hold me

[Chorus]
Flip a switch on a prick, then I
Come alive in the nighttime
In the club, sippin' Hennessy
And tell him I'm dead if he callin' me (Ooh)
Flip a switch on a prick and I'm
A very sound bitch till you cross that line
Black heels, black shades, that my energy (That my energy)
Tell him I'm dead if he callin' me

Ooh, oh no, oh no, no, no, no, no
Ooh, oh no, ooh, ah, oh
Only because I was in love, I opened up
Now I'll open up to your best friend, which one?
Bitch like me, I just had to flip the switch on you (Ooh)

Flip a switch on a prick, then I
Come alive in the nighttime

Ceilings, plaster
Can't you just make it move faster?

My shoes are now full of water
Lovely to be rained on with you
It's kinda cute but it's so short

And I don't wanna leave
But I have to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before

Touch me like nobody else does
Lovely to just lay here with you
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos

I heard Jesus did cocaine on a night out
Eyes wide open, dilated, but he's fine now
And if his father ever finds out, then he'd probably knock his lights out
Gets a little messy in Heaven, gets a little messy in Heaven

[Verse 1]
Barefoot on the pavement, he was never complacent
Held his ground for the town and the statement
Leader, never backs out of the arrangеment
Speaks out to the wholе crowd when he saves them
But he was the one that needed saving
Now he's low-key crushed on the inside
He gave his all and now he's breaking
You can see it in his eyes

[Chorus]
I heard Jesus did cocaine on a night out
Eyes wide open, dilated, but he's fine now
And if his father ever finds out, then he'd probably knock his lights out
Gets a little messy in Heaven, gets a little messy in Heaven

[Verse 2]
He's staying out on the weekdays, weekends
No sleep for the weak 'round here
Going out, getting lost in the deep end
White lines never dried no tears
He says no more, now he says no less
And the people wanna know where he goes next
Mind of a saint, so he knows best
But he don't sleep, nah, he don't rest
Turning water into wine, that's mad, that's mad
Everybody always wants what he has

Watching Evangelion with a big fat slug of ketamine
I lost the plot a little while ago, oh-oh
My dog just died, my friends hate me
I saw myself on MTV, and my ego is not my amigo (Yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, maybe I don't belong on this planet
Red crescent moons all over my hands
It's too much to take, I can't understand it
Someone tell me

[Chorus]
Why am I this way?
Stupid medicine, not doin' anything
What the hell is fucking wrong with me?
I guess there's no remedy, I'm so terribly lost

[Verse 2]
Imaginary enemies, suicidal tendеncies
Serotonin's proper on its arsе, oh-oh
I used to go to therapy, but the doctor tried to section me
The next time that I open up to someone will be my autopsy
Because

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think I belong on this planet
Red crescent moons all over my hands
It's too much to take, I can't fucking stand it
Someone tell me

Can't rap about beef
Or the streets

On the back of the bike, Beverly
Jumpеd out swinging my choppa, NLE
I'm on the verge of purgе, especially when they keep testing me
I gotta protect my energy
My friends ain't there mentally (Nope)
Don't ask me questions, respectfully (Yeah)
'Cause I won't answer sensibly
I just wanna murder senselessly
Armed heavily
Shoot since secondary, do it professionally
Kill confirmed, don't message me
You wanna see these results? Keep testing me (Bap, bap)

When I look back, all of us stressed our mothers, in prison for five whole summers
Mum ain't dumb, she's clued up, know what my crew does when we go step in with cutters
Who knows if God still fucks with me
All of the fuckery, some of it troubles me
All of the things that I'm going through currently
I just need someone to show love and cuddle me (Yeah)
Dead or in jail, man been there six times, I'm tryna avoid the other one
I brought another gun, dodging the Babylon, I know I'm troublesome

587,Relax My Eyes,ANOTR,The Reset,59,"1 ContributorKill the Spirit LyricsIn the ghetto, where you hardly see love
Sometimes hugs, but a whole lotta thugs and drugs
The value of life is low
Brothers hanging out, straight going with the flow
But the flow is twisted and wicked
You don't agree, you need to check the statistics, man
It should make you think
Can't you see the black male's on the brink of becoming extinct?

So I stop, dwell on that thought, it brings tears to my eyes
Another homicide makes me realise time is passing
Too much time is passing, so I'm going to the mountains for fasting
And that it takes place
Here I am, right back in your face with a revelation I gotta take to this nation
'Cause my people are dying of starvation, spiritually
So me, I jump on the stair, and relax
Grab my axe, and teach, over drum track, the facts which some lack
And that's the reason they act they way they act, thinking they're identifying with black
But ignorance is not black, though my people are straight-up portraying that
Selling crack in the communities, and then swearing that they're down with black unity

Yo, who ya fooling B?
Your own race, man
Are you down with the skin-heads or the klan?
I wanna know; yo, what's up with that?
Why are you so quick to peel brother man's
Cap another black on black
Shorty's locked up, home-girl's knocked up
Fell for the scam played by the male who swears he's a man
You might also likeHe never loved you, so like why should he care?
As he tells you to get on welfare
So, here we go, through the same old cycle
Playboy dad, fatherless child that'll probably just grow up buck-wild in poverty
Well, you're grabbing for something, but you're always coming back with nothing but broken dreams

Man, it seems straight useless, and that's the reason Slack produced this jam
Take of the blindfold, pushed there to realise you are the eyes of the church
And that's why ya like straight getting worked over time
'Cause once we fall in line, with a clear mind, it's revival time
So out comes the KJV 66, in goes the clip
I got my hand on the trigger, busting shots at the spirit called ""nigga""

A super shout-out to the Cush man
What you don't understand, the oldest son of Ham - Cush, the Cush man
Or, better yet, should I say Ethiopian?
A people, tall with smooth, brown skin
These parts of the bible seem to be forgotten
You see, it's not unknown, it's just not taught

I'll be the first one to pull the trigger, and kill that spirit called ""nigga"" that's been keeping my people way low, pretending everything is mellow
Well, I'm sending shouts to the ghetto
Know who you are, so you can reach your full potential
See, your history is not a mystery, it extends way beyond the sixteenth century

And the bible will clearly expose this, in Numbers 12:1, with Miriam and the wife of Moses
Interracial marriage, God didn't oppose this, but you won't find that looking at the video
Of course, you have to go to the source, and break free from the chains of the spirit that's left us all incoherent, and blind to the fact that Jesus washed that all at the cross
Some call it a tree; nevertheless, we're free - that means you and me
'Cause Jesus took the key, got up on the tree
So get rid of the peas, and pile Galatians 3:28 on your plate
Get your aim straight, and kill that spirit called ""nigga""
Spirits from hell are assigned against nations
Communities, races, a problem everyone faces
Devil, I'm taking authority over, in the name of Jesus
I bind and render your work, in order to shatter your plan to pieces

Apprehending the enemy
It's written that he should, and must be, bound before I enter and take his goods

Impart truth in ya, like an educated teacher
Living, though in time, in time, say, rhyme, preacher

Trained an equipped for war, armored still
Return to put the demons on the scope for kill

Prayed before we started, nigga spirit, we bought it
'Cause I'm addressing the last of the nigga spiritual target

As we rebuild and get rid of it
If you get it, you dig it
And we're not talking about the minute to find my anglo bits
Neither would a brother call another brother
We're speaking of a spirit that's the sign of black minds in all of mankind

Keeping you divided, envious, filled with greed, jealous of the next man - don't wanna see him succeed
Lazy and complaisant, with consumer mentality
Strangle and protect your genes and creativity
But God gives you the ability to obtain wealth
You're sticking out your hand, looking for help from someone else
Blaming it on the next man, feeling that you got to
But, with Christ and the Holy Ghost, nobody can stop you

To some, welfare is a curse from hell, no apology
Is the system designed to keep recipients in poverty?
If you're depending on the system, forgetting your gifts or job
And keep you from fulfilling your purpose in God

As soon as you get some money, you spend it with the careers
Never save or invest, but just so people can see 'em looking cool
But won't get a free PAEL grant for school
If your vision is blurry, clear it

Hotter than Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
Steppin' out the rave, gyallies start watchin'
Turn into Picasso, watch me draw somethin'
Chat they say they bad, but they all bluffin'
Through the flashin' lights in the dance, see the ravers all rushin'

You ain't gotta be the richest, just be the realest
My acclaim's critical, but I'm a fuckin' cynic
You're a fuckin' gimmick, mimic
Do it all for the image, but never really did it
I can't rest, I'm too wicked, I feel my mood switchin'
I ain't never gave nobody a problem who didn't want it
All you had to do was show me and I went and got it
There's an elephant in the room, but I'm sittin' on it
I got mental scars from this shit, but we're livin' off it
When they bring the streets up, I think you should switch the topic
If I'm bein' real, I don't mind, we can split the profit
I wake up and bill a rocket, last year, I saw my first M
This year, I need a couple profit, I got no timе to sit and gossip
And that's word to the trap I kicked in for the things I wantеd
Ambition like mine, let me know when you come across it
They'll probably come across it and then double-cross it
Make all of them mistakes and then learn nothin' from it
It hits a little different when you're comin' from it
The struggle, that's what made you, why you runnin' from it?
I been a real dope boy, you can't beat my grind
Can't break my spirit, in the shade, I shine
You need guns when you're mixed up in beef like mine
It's hard not to smile when you got some teeth like mine
Nanny told me, ""Don't go out there, boy, it's cold outside""
I question everything I stood for and rode my time
Time and time again, one of me and there's five of them
I bring my knees to my chest and I rise again
I don't care who I might offend
If you ain't love me in the first place, why pretend?
If I sit and think about all the nights I spent on some heartbroke shit
'Cah my body gave up, but my heart won't quit
I bought fourteen grams, but my half won't flip
I got laces and boots, goals and assists
Fifty jailhouse fades, on Neighbourhood Crip
I really live this shit, you're a rappin'-ass bitch
I lost so many mates, I rub shoulders with greats
On these council estate
Tenth floor in the stairs, we used to hide from the rain
Fell in love with the life just to hide from the shade
Still shine in the shade
Kill the ego, maintain, humble, I remain
Still, I go against the grain
Real back in style, let them hate 'cause they know we are what they ain't
I wanna tell you that I'm strugglin', but I can't find the words
I wanna stay with you forever, but I need some millions first
I know that seems surprising 'cause I been a trillionaire
Blue plates and plastic bowls, I don't come from silverware
Don't get yourself killed in here
Before I sleep, I say a prayer
They got bags of energy, but nothin' to declare
This life, it left me broke, I just need someone to repair
I watched him take a lift and kept on runnin' up the stairs
I can leave the streets and just rap, I got shares
I'm too busy gettin' mine to think about yours
You can ask Theo, he was tickin' me drawers
I won't talk about the people who was givin' me squares, I ain't forgettin'
Pissed down the block, screws put me on default
They let me out for dinner and I jumped on the nettin'
I'm more rejoicin' than regrettin'
'Cah if they never kicked my head in and stripped me naked and took my beddin'
If I never climbed out all the holes I fell in
If I never had scraps, I didn't know the swellin'
If I never sold smack, I didn't know what Hell is
Then it's freedom itself, I wouldn't know the blessin'
Then they wouldn't be callin' me the hope and message
Now we're copacetic, can we toast a beverage?

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

And you're not here to get me through it all

White ash on my hotel floor room
Feds still watchin', hopin' they get bored soon
I'm bored of the fame, but that's my good fortune
I keep losin' all my friends and that subject's sore too
Never switch on me, I know I can't force you
I can't trust you, how could I endorse you?
I just hope you run with everything I taught you
I said I just hope you run with everything I taught you
I got white ash on these custom seats and I'm custer-free
Not talkin' in the car, they probably bugged the veecs
Go and hug your kids about you hug the streets
I don't smoke pagans, I smoke ganja leaf
I got guns for beef and leave sons deceasеd
He's always talkin' the most, but he doеs the least
We go kway back, I known him since dungarees
Probably hate me 'cause I know you never done the greaze
'Magine if we went school, we could've done degrees
'Stead we was sellin' crack, bitch, run the P's
Now I'm a rap star, they think I fund the streets
I got white ash on my kitchen counter
Smoke in my eye while I sit and count
I keep thinkin' 'bout yesterday's encounter
I know they're schemin' on me, I'ma lick him down
I seen man run for his life and get disembowelled
And his friends don't ride, they just miss him now
And he raps and they all wanna diss him now
Either that or they're all arse-lickin' now
I got white ash in the boardroom
I'm rappin' with execs, they're actin' all cordial
You're an informer and they treat me informal
My kids are adorable
I'm head of the family, I make it affordable
I'm killin' the rap game and holdin' memorials
Subscribe to my YouTube, I'm givin' tutorials
I rose from the crack smoke, that's different euphorias
White ash in his pipe, Frank White, I'm notorious
I was kippin' in Gloria's
Paid three for the rent, steady livin' inglorious
They ain't tryna do it, not unless there's an audience
Not a leg to stand on, he's still shootin', he think he's Oscar Pistorius
White ash on my booth floor, I don't need a chorus
They'll have you stuck in time and the jails are Victorian
My licence just done and I'm feelin' victorious
I'm curvin' all these bitches, they ain't got no decorum
I got white ash on my hotel floor room
Feds still watchin', hopin' they get bored soon
I'm bored of the fame, but that's my good fortune
I keep losin' all my friends and that subject's sore too

Have some heart, but make sure it's open
Take that risk 'cause time gets stolen
Maybe speak less and listen more
'Cause life's too short, you only have one
It might sound cliché
But your life can start when you choose it to
When you choose it to

[Chorus]
'Cause if there's something you wanna do
Just do it
Don't let your head stop your heart from moving
If there's someone you wanna talk to
Talk to 'em
Who knows who we'd be if we just
Live more and love more
Who knows who we'd be if we just
Live more and love more
[Outro]
Who knows who we'd be if we just
Live more and love more
Who knows who we'd be if we just
Live more and love moreEmbed","Give the paraphrase you'd like to see:

[Intro]
I'm tired of loving you
I'm tired of all the crying
I'm tired of all the fighting
I'm tired of all the pain

[Verse 1]
It's like I'm stuck in a cycle
Tried to break it but I failed
Can't remember the last time
I've felt at ease
I'm always tired of the same
I'm always tired of you
I'm always tired of the
Games that you play
You're always lying to me
And I'm tired of being caught

[Pre-Chorus]
Between the lines of your words
I see the truth
It's a game that we play
But I'm so tired of this

[Chorus]
So I'll say goodbye
I'm gonna let you go
'Cause I'm tired of loving you
I'm tired of all the crying
I'm tired of all the fighting
I'm tired of all the pain

[Verse 2]
I've been searching for happiness
For a long time now
And I'm always searching for answers
But I'm always lost somehow
I'm always tired of the same
I'm always tired of you
I'm always tired of the
Games that you play
You're always lying to me
And I'm tired of being caught

(That's Chucks)
Thought it was go time, like, from the jump
(Emz Beats)

[Verse 1: Potter Payper]
I link T on my just rap, you can blow shit
Still think I'm Boston George on my blow shit
My boy's in a SVR, but he stole it
I flew past **** with my wap, told him hold it
Man keep talkin' my name, they keep trollin'
When they're more pussy than the pussyoles they roll with
Can't be pillow talkin' in these streets, I disown him (Yo)
Can't be talkin' about me, I kick doors in (Check)

[Verse 2: Tunde]
I link P on my jack jones in the morning
He was one up too 'cause we're staunch and they know this
My boys in a SRT, he didn't rent it
Took chase from the black bonnet and he bent it
I flew past the back of the еstate to go and pick him up
I sent Cappy round therе and told him, ""Go and lift him up""
'Cause man keep chattin' man name, they keep cappin' it
But one ****, so now I keep **** it

[Verse 3: Potter Payper]
I've been buying watches and guns, that's insurance
Runnin' this for ten years runnin', that's endurance
I ain't worried bout nobody, they're all jokers
Like I ain't been steppin' with hammers and big boarers
Standin' on strip corners, scammers and extorters
Came too far to be standing with informers
Talk 'bout the money and then it just gets awkward
Talk 'bout the duppies and then it just gets awkward again (Yo)
You might also like[Verse 4: Tunde]
I've been buying crypto and pounds, that's investing
Buyin' great Cali and Cane, this ain't wrestling
Big dogs, stepped on the steppers when we stepped in
Get money out of houses and lofts, its interesting
I've been rollin' round with some farmers, but they ain't got shotties
Know some man that turned into nitties because they got bodies
Growin' like we're in the cartel, but we don't crop poppies
Clippin' off the noses of dog, call it chopped rotties

[Verse 5: Potter Payper]
For the judge and the jury, this is entertainment
You can't be lockin' up rappers for your entertainment
I paid tax three years, never missed a payment
I'm from the mud, somehow I'm sophisticated
Might fly to a gallery and grip a painting
Used to sleep on floors, I don't need persuading
Now mummy got a CC purse with suede in
But bitch, I'd rather be rich than famous

[Verse 6: Tunde]
'Cause bitch, I'd rather be rich than famous
Got stitched by the pigs and it hit the papers
Snitch boys in the ends, gotta ditch the haters

I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hand's been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across thе border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it mеans to be livin'

[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruising and entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
Said I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 1: Nines]
I'm from the hood, now I live in a mansion
These niggas are mad, I'm counting these bags while I sit in a Phantom
Word to my jewellers, I spent quarter mill on my wrist and medallion
They said I'm ugly, and now I get money she thinks that I'm handsome
Touched down Dubai with the gang and we had a fun night
Went straight to the Louis V shop, from there we went Club White
Remember them days on the estate when we had to fight over nitties
Now it's tour dates and all these bitches ask me to sign on their titties
Won't see me in a club with no shank, fam, I always bring my strally
Before I went jail I was selling stardawg and bricks of ammi
When I had no packs I had to take a trip to Cali
I ain't even bring no suitcase, I just bought a list of addys
They ain't trapping like me, we ain't got the same quotes
If you ain't tryna buy a yacht next year, we ain't in the same boat
Niggas know I'm a plug, got bottom shelf and expensive weed
And I got mids, got bandos and dispensaries

[Verse 2: Clavish]
I just left mummy's house
The runners down on my feet, two and a Q
Respect from my niggas up in the trap
If it weren't for rap I'd be in there too
The feds, they hate me
They know I done some shavings bait but left no clue
Brought a hunting knife to war
Cah the three-eight never had no shoes
Told me she's leaving, why?
Cause I'm a rapper wasting her time
She hates when I'm up in DXB
Cause she knows what I do in Dubai
I end up giving them dick
I step in the club and never say ""Hi""
Then end up bussing my nut
And book her a cab, I never said ""Bye""
Course I got money, you can tell by the rip in my jeans
I'm at an awards show with my niggas daydreamin' bout hitting the fiends
I ride out sober, me and big homie pull up on the opps, drinking their lean
On road he was the baddest, went to jail now he on his deen
My niggas, they tell me to chill
Saying I spend too much on jackets
When it's time for guns I buy them, I think I spend too much on mashes
I buy waps but I'm into fashion, rather the Culli than the Phantom
I got a couple hoes from Glasgow
They just wanna fuck on me and the mandem

I'm 'bout to turn the heat up, gonna make your glasses steam
Ooh, tell me what you, what you, what you gon' do, ooh

It was just two lovers
Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde, fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish, no Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, ""Where you at tonight?""
Got no alibi

[Pre-Chorus]
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

[Chorus]
Shine
It's your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast, burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?

Somebody need to tell 'em that they can't do it like I can

Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you

Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh

In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was

Answer the phone
""Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?""
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

Road shimmer wigglin' the vision

Road shimmer wigglin' the vision

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
[Bridge]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out

I remember the sickness was forever
I remember snuff videos
Cold Septembers, the distances we covered
The fist fights on the beach
The Bizzies round us up
Do it all again next week
An embryonic love
The first time that it scarred
Embarrass yourself for someone
Cryin' like a child
And the boy who kicked Tom's head in
Still bugs me now
That's the thing, it lingers
And claws you when you're down

[Verse 2]
I was far too scared to hit him
But I would hit him in a heartbeat now
That's the thing with anger, it begs to stick around
So it can fleece you of your beauty
And leave you spent with nowt to offer
Makes you hurt the ones who love you

You hurt them like they're nothin'

Uoy evol I, sdrow rehto ni

[Chorus]
It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin' in
'Nough man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on a private jet
Life or death, five-five
Eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected

[Verse 1]
I do know my man, but I don't trust him
Trust that, Ps in the trap, disgustin'
Stick with the stick, PVA, PDA, kiss that in public
South London where I made my
South London's where I made my first hundred
Elastic bands, plastic bags, two and a blue like cheese and onion
In Jamaica, quick vacation, travellin' my pastimе
'Nough pollution in the ends, I flew back yard 'cah I wanna see starlight
Eritrеan, skin tone cinnamon, I think I found my princess
My empress, still gonna impress
I know 'dem man talk on the kid, but

Eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected

[Verse 2]
Any girl that I'm datin' knows, bags that I buy come filled with fifties
She a ten out of ten on a bad day, public affection, I tell her, ""Come kiss me""
I like mine obsessed, clingy
If she don't miss me, miss me
If she don't miss me, history
If she don't miss me, it's a mystery
G17 in the party, tipsy
Don't drink, that's risky
Focus, shells gonna land like Disney
And put him down under, Sydney
That's bae, I'll donate both my kidneys
True love, what the kid needs
And a girl from the Westest Indies
I know them man talk on the kid but
[Chorus]
It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin' in
'Nough man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on the private jet
Life or death, five-five
Eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected

[Verse 3]
In this world that I'm in
How you wanna take pics with the belts in the ring
But don't help in the gym?
'Nough girls datin' their biggest haters
How her boyfriend don't want her to win? Like, rah
And why my girlfriend never wanna see me have a good time out if she ain't there?
Yeah, yeah (Fly— Fly me to the moon)
Fly me to the moon, let me get some space
Seein' them stars on her private story
I dust that chick, she got no grace
(Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter)
See her ex man, she got no taste, hip dip, she got no waist
Body snatched, servin' face (In other words, hold my hand)
Haha, hold my hand, personal trainer
Frequent flyer, bad, she toned and tan
Free my gang, 013's and 020's (Darlin' miss me)
Oh God knows, I miss my bros
I just got a call from jail on the phone and that might
[Outro: Ree Paramagita]
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore

Forget you and your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-down car and the things you call art
Forget you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all get lost

[Verse 1]
I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start, hmm
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection
It's likе you'd do anythin' for my affection
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways

[Pre-Chorus]
I was into you, but I'm ovеr it now
And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out

[Chorus]
A-B-C-D-E, forget you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-down car and the things you call art
Forget you and your friends that I'll never see again

You said you just needed space and so I gave it
When I had nothin' to say, you couldn't take it
Told everyone I'm a—, so I became it
Always had to put yourself above me

[Pre-Chorus]
I was into you, but I'm over it now
And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out

[Chorus]
A-B-C-D-E, forget you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your craigslist couch and the way your voice sounds
Forget you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all get lost

There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up

Go back and make it right
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Yeah, we've been here before
Inside my heart is breaking my heart, I know

And I'm sorry, it's all that I can take
I'll stop my heart from breaking
When I finally get up the courage to
Say all the things that I wanna say

I've been looking back on all the love that I've been given

I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hand's been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love

Father, forgive me
For I have sinned
My soul it has been cleansed
But I'm still filled with sin
And you'll always be the only man
Who gave me everything
You are the father of my only son
And he is the image of your skin

And it's so hard to apologize
When you know you're right
But you know you're gonna die
So you lie

For a man to carry
But I'll try to shoulder the blame
And I'll take the shame

Comin' out of my cage and I've been doin' just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm fallin' asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's takin' a drag
Now they're goin' to bed, and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

[Pre-Chorus]
Chest now, he takes off her dress now
Let me go
And I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

The year has just started and right now, I'm lookin' for cribs overseas
I'm givin' my lady some drivin' lessons in a hundred-grand Jeep
When you see me in public, no photos, man, I need some privacy please
Good girl, she just sat on my face now she's sayin' her legs have gone weak
Bad, bad, see the jakes outside, now I'm flushin' the work down the toilet
Mad, mad, Richard Mille, a crib by the port and it's imported
Sad, sad, if you knew the truth 'bout that nigga then it would get awkward
And I know that nigga get money now, I am the nigga that taught him

[Verse 1: Young Adz]
Bro, I get the birds in, fuck a drought
Worker is misbehavin', chuck him out
I get the money, money from her house
Out in a lovely, lovely country town
I said, if you care about her, fly her out
Go to the Louis store and buy it now
I'ma keep pourin' 'til I'm runnin' out
I just hit it from the back, she scared, she runnin' out
Ooh, young and lit, money keep on comin' in
Ooh, I keep a rock band on standby, pull up and drum that shit
Ooh, deep in it, I'ma swim, hand on heart, I love this chick
Ooh, all them niggas 'round me family, love them on some brother shit

[Verse 2: Central Cee]
She suck my soul, she done it like Ash Kaash, I keep on gettin' them flashbacks
I was OT so I had to bash, I almost thought about gettin' a cab back
Do it like Rico and video that, if we upload it,  it'll probably get some backlash
Backshots, she got the ripple effect, it's too temptin' and I can't help but slap that
Fuck that, pull out, I don't wanna be a dad yet
Plan B, girl, you gotta swallow that tablet
The way that she handle it, this one talented
Pum-pum soakin', feel like I'm paddlin'
Back come 'round, I'm a fan of it
Ride on a bike one time and saddle it (Oh)
Ayo, her doctor workin' wonders
Damn, that's a big circumference (Oh)
Get her wet, she don't need no lube
On the fortieth floor, you should see the views (Alright)
She don't wanna send me her pussy on Snapchat, madman, I don't wanna leak your nudes
How do I say it without seemin' rude? (Huh)
I just wanna see if it's cute
Shake that back like a video vixen
This one here don't wanna be in my tunes
She wanna go Nobu just for the Snap
If I pay for the tab, you best eat your food
Word on the road is Cench get a hunnid a show
This ho' wan' see if it's true
Posh ting, she don't wanna be with the squares no more, she said she wanna be with the goons
Thought she could hack it, not active, too smoky, now she wanna leave the room

I'm the strong one, I'm not nervous
I'm as tough as the crust of the Earth is
I move mountains, I move churches
And I glow, 'cause I know what my worth is
I don't ask how hard the work is
Got a rough, indestructible surface
Diamonds and platinum, I find 'em, I flatten 'em
I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded, but

[Verse 1]
Under the surface
I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus
Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like, ""Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus?""
Under the surface
I'm pretty surе I'm worthless if I can't be of servicе

[Pre-Chorus]
A flaw or a crack, the straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back
What breaks the camel's back, it's

[Chorus]
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's older
Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder
Who am I if I can't run with the ball?
If I fall to
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger
See if she can hang on a little longer
Who am I if I can't carry it all?
If I falter

I hide my nerves and it worsens, I worry somethin' is gonna hurt us

The ship doesn't swerve, has it heard how big the iceberg is?
Under the surface
I think about my purpose, can I somehow preserve this?
Line up the dominoes, a light wind blows
You try to stop it tumbling, but on and on it goes

[Bridge]
But wait, if I could shake the crushing weight of expectations
Would that free some room up for joy
Or relaxation, or simple pleasure?
Instead, we measure this growing pressure
Keeps growing, keep going, 'cause all we know is

[Chorus]
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, it doesn't hurt and
See if she can handle every family burden
Watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks
No mistakes, just

Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister and never wonder
If the same pressure would've pulled you under
Who am I if I don't have what it takes?

(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh)

[Verse 1]
You want the girl with the small waist
And the perfect smile
Someone who's out every weekday
In her dad's new car
You tell me I shouldn't stress out
Say, ""It's not that hard""
But I just got a feeling
This will leave an ugly scar

[Pre-Chorus]
If you say, ""She's nothing to worry about""
Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?

[Chorus]
Stupid boy making me so sad
Didn't think you could change this fast
She's got everything that I don't have
How could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind
One day wake up and be bored with mine
She's got everything that I don't havе
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad, so bad
Shе's got everything that I don't have, hm-mm
You might also like[Verse 2]
You want someone you can show off
Whenever you go out
She'll wear a tight mini black dress
With all her friends around
And then you'll probably spend the night at
Her nice big house
And by then I'll just be someone
You've forgotten about, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
If you say, ""She's nothing to worry about""
Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?

[Chorus]
Stupid boy making me so sad
Didn't think you could change this fast
She's got everything that I don't have
How could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind
One day wake up and be bored with mine
She's got everything that I don't have
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad, so bad
She's got everything that I don't have
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be

She's all I wanna be so bad, oh-ooh

Stupid boy making me so sad
Didn't think you would hurt this bad
She's got everything that I don't have
How could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind
One day wake up and be bored with mine
She's got everything that I don't have
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad

Você reza pelos meus demônios, garota, eu entendo você
Toda vez que eu bebo codeína, fico vulnerável
Eu conheço os sons da tempestade quando ela chеga
Ela entende quе eu não posso levar ela pra todos os lugares que eu vou
Eu estive no campo tipo os filhos do milho

[Refrão: Future & Tems]
Eu posso ouvir suas lágrimas quando elas caem pelo telefone
Fica brava consigo mesma porque não consegue me deixar em paz
Fofoca, arrumando bagunça, isso não é o que estamos fazendo (O mundo estava acabando)
Viajar ao redor do mundo (Você choraria ou tentaria me pegar?)
Pelo telefone, derramando lágrimas (Me diga agora, eu quero que você seja claro, yeah)
Eu fico mais vulnerável quando tomo pílulas (Me diga agora, eu quero que você seja claro, yeah)
Quando você tá bêbada, você me diz exatamente como se sente (Eu vou esperar por você, por você)
Quando eu tô carregado, mantenho a real (Eu vou esperar por você, vou esperar por você)

Eu vou estar te ligando, os sentimentos estão fluindo como um rio
Você vai estar mandando mensagens de volta pra Kiki no rio (Eu vou esperar por você)
A mensagem foi entregue (Eu vou esperar por você), mas eu sei que você não leu
Por que você nos apresenta se você sabia que tava com ele? (Eu vou esperar por você, por você, por você)
Me fez apertar a mão dele quando vocês estavam transando à um minuto (Eu vou esperar por você, por você)
Me fez caminhar na prancha, porque você sabe que eu sou um nadador (Eu vou esperar por você)
Eu deveria ser seu cachorro, mas você me colocou num canil
Garota, coloque uma focinheira nisso, em todos aqueles latidos durante o jantar
Eu tava fechado com você quando você ganhou o Presidencial pequeno
Você melhorou quando me conheceu e isso não é coincidência
Tentei trazer o melhor de você, acho que eu não sou tão influente
Acho que eu não sou o cara para você

This is a cause for celebration

So still, the fire's barely fighting the cold

Just when I'm almost letting you go

I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass

But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

And I'm okay

And I'm good

And I'm strong

But I'm not sure

That I'm ready

To forget

'Cause I'm still hung up

On the thought of you

And I'm alright

And I'm fine

And I'm okay

But I'm not sure

That I'm ready

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me

And you're not here to get me through it all

Anyone For You (Tiger Lily) Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I was young, I found a Tiger Lily
In the field right by my grandad's house
I remember, she was a beautiful sight
As I ran my hand down her stem and her leaves
And her roots were deep in the ground
But she blossomed quickly, she was a wondrous sight

[Chorus]
If anyone for you, Tiger Lily, I'd leave them be
If anyone for you, I'd take you back out to that field
If anyone for you, I'd take you back out to that field

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

And I'm a monster on the hill

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

In my floating castle, I'd rub shoulders with the stars

To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

[Verse 3]
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own

One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
He took me in his arms, I heard him say
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die (Good job, Sho)
My father told me

[Chorus: SwitchOTR]
Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
I'll-I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
You-you better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you
Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
I'll-I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
You-you better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you

[Verse 1: SwitchOTR]
See, I ain't really into the verbal
My broski strapped, no Dijk, no Virgil
The van might buss that circle
See, I'm tryna blow off this music ting
And pray that I end up commercial
And 'bout time that I make some records
Show them why that I go universal
('Cause I can't) 'Cause I can't get stuck in the ends
I need me a yard with a big ass fence
Lambo truck or Mercedes-Benz
No fake love, no need to pretend
If I cut you off, it's straight intent
Guys out here tryna drill and repent
Same bad B that I need in defence
The J1's coulda been A1, but I can't follow the latest trends
Broski might handle the can and let off shots, 'cause the bullets bisexual
It's really for them boy there, can definitely hit that bitch right next to you
Every time I rap on the beat, gotta show them why man feels presentable
And chicks love pick and choose their guys like a video game collectible

'Cause we're coming for you

[Verse 2: J1mulla & A1orFundz]
Bare man change, people fake (Mm-mm)
The world so fucked nowadays, I don't trust no one
'Cause they lied to my face (they lied)
I can't stop working, we all die one day
Back then, I was lonely (Lonely)
I ain't got time for these phonies (Phonies)
Got my bro like Zack got Cody
I'm a top boy like Modie (Ah-ah)
Anti-social, I don't like to socialize
They cap on the net, that's social lies
When brodie died, I cried, that's real life
I feel a way, I just don't feel right
Could've been homeless
My heart so cold, it's frozen
DTB, I find it hard to open
I've been busy livin' life in the moment
Reason why I ain't got time to lotion
[Chorus: SwitchOTR]
Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
I'll-I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members

Iris Lyrics[Verse 1]
And she's been my inspiration
Since I met her in the physical
And she'll be my inspiration
Until I get myself together

[Verse 2]
And then when I close my eyes
Feel her so close to me
Every night in my dreams
That's where I'd like to be

[Bridge]
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

[Chorus]
And you could be the one to throw it all away
And in the end
You will be the one to blame
And you could be the one to throw it all away
And in the end
You will be the one to blame
You could be the one to throw it all away

No Excuses Lyrics[Verse 1]
Aye, I'm on a mission to make it to the top
Lately, I've been workin' so hard, I'm on the verge of droppin'
All my life, I've been waitin' for my big break
And now that I'm finally here, I'm not about to take it for granted
I've been grindin' for years, now I'm finally gettin' mine
I can't stop now, I've come too far, I'm not about to give up on my dreams
No excuses, no excuses, no excuses, no excuses
I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna make it

[Chorus]
I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna make it
No excuses, no excuses, no excuses, no excuses
I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna make it

Drawers!
Floors!
Doors!
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Mirabel & Ensemble, Both]
This is our home, we've got every generation
So full of music, the rhythm of its own design
This is my family, a perfect constellation
So many stars and everybody gets to shine
Woah (Oh-oh-oh-oh), let's be clear, Abuela runs this show
Woah (Oh-oh-oh-oh), she led us here so many years ago
Woah (Oh-oh-oh-oh), and every year our family blessings grow!
There's just a lot, you simply got to know, so

[Chorus: Mirabel]
Welcome to the Family Madrigal
The home of the Family Madrigal (We're on our way!)
Wherе all the people arе fantastical and magical
I'm part of the Family Madrigal

[Interlude 1]
[Alejandra, Juancho & Cecilia] ""Oh my gosh, it's them!""
[Alejandra] ""What are the gifts?""
[Cecilia] ""I can't remember all the gifts""
[Alejandra] ""But I don't know who is who""
[Mirabel] ""Mm-mm-, alright, alright, relax!""
[Alejandra] ""It is physically impossible to relax!""
[Cecilia] ""Tell us everything! What are your powers?""
[Juancho] ""Just tell us what everyone can do!""
[Mirabel] ""And that's why coffee's for grown-ups""
You might also like[Verse 2: Mirabel & Ensemble]
My tía Pepa, her mood affects the weather
When she's unhappy, well, the temperature gets weird
My tío Bruno (We don't talk about Bruno!)
They say he saw the future, one day he disappeared
Oh (Oh-oh-oh-oh), and that's my mom Julieta, here's her deal
Woah! (Oh-oh-oh-oh), the truth is, she can heal you with a meal
Woah! (Oh-oh-oh-oh), her recipes are remedies for real
If you're impressed, imagine how I feel—Mom!

[Chorus: Mirabel, Mirabel, Felix & Agustín]
Welcome to the Family Madrigal
The home of the Family Madrigal (Hey, coming through!)
I know it sounds a bit fantastical and magical
But I'm part of the Family Madrigal
Two guys fell in love with Family Madrigal (Hey, Family Madrigal!)
And now they're part of the Family Madrigal
So, yeah, Tío Félix married Pepa and my dad married Julieta
That's how Abuela became an Abuela Madrigal (Let's go, let's go!)

[Verse 3: Abuela]
We swear to always help those around us
And earn the miracle that somehow found us
The town keeps growing, the world keeps turning
But work and dedication will keep the miracle burning
And each new generation must keep the miracle burning
[Interlude 2]
[Alejandra] ""Wait— who's a sister and who's a cousin?""
[Cecilia] ""There's so many people!""
[Juancho] ""How do you keep them all straight?""
[Mirabel] Okay, okay, okay, okay

[Bridge: Mirabel & Townspeople]
So many kids in our house, so let's turn the sound up!
You know why? I think it's time for a grandkid round-up!
(Grandkid round-up!)

[Verse 4: Mirabel & Townspeople, Both]
Cousin Dolores can hear a pin drop
Camilo shapeshifts, Antonio gets his gift today
My older sisters, Isabela and Luisa
One strong, one graceful, perfect in every way
(Isabela!) Grows a flower, the town goes wild
(Isabela!) She's the perfect golden child
(Luisa! Luisa! Luisa! Luisa!) And Luisa's super strong
The beauty and the brawn do no wrong

[Chorus: Mirabel & Ensemble]
That's life in the Family Madrigal (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now you know the Family Madrigal (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Where all the people are fantastical and magical (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
That's who we are in the Family Madrigal
[Interlude 3]
[Mirabel] ¡Adiós! ""Ooo!""
[Alejandra] ""But what's your gift?""
[Mirabel] Ha!

[Chorus: Mirabel & Ensemble]
Well, I gotta go, the life of a Madrigal (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
But now you all know the Family Madrigal (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I never meant this to get autobiographical (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
So just to review the Family Madrigal, let's go

[Verse 5: Mirabel & Children]
(But what about Mirabel?)
It starts with Abuela, and then Tía Pepa, she handles the weather
(But what about Mirabel?)
My mom Julieta can make you feel better with just one arepa
(But what about Mirabel?)
My dad Agustín, well, he's accident-prone but he means well
(But what about Mirabel?)
Hey, you said you wanna know what everyone does, I got sisters and cousins and (Mirabel!)
My primo Camilo won't stop until he makes you smile today (Mirabel!)
My cousin Dolores can hear this whole chorus a mile away (Mirabel!)
Look! It's Mister Mariano, hey
You can marry my sister if you wanna
But between you and me, she's kind of a prima donna
Yo, I've said too much, and thank you but I really gotta go! (Mirabel!)
My family's amazing! (Mirabel!)
And I'm in my family, so (Mirabel!)
Well

And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
[Verse 2]
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside, it starts to pour

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the tide
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you (Crawlin' back to you)
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few? (Had a few)
'Cause I always do ('Cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (Maybe I'm too busy)
Busy bein' yours (Bein' yours)
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you
[Outro]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
(Do I wanna know?) Too busy bein' yours to fall
(Sad to see you go) Ever thought of callin', darlin'?

I can be your lady, I'm a woman

Put some babies in your life and take away the drama
Put the paper in a picture like a diorama
Gotta face a lot of people of the opposite
'Cause the world told me, ""We ain't got the common sense""
Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of shit
And you would never know a god without the goddesses
Honest as fuckin' honest get
And I could be on everything
I mean I could be the leader, head of all the states
I could smile and jiggle it 'til his pockets empty
I could be the CEO, just look at Robyn Fenty
And I'ma be there for you 'cause you on my team, girl
Don't ever think you ain't hella these niggas dream girl
They wanna pit us against each other
When we succeedin' for no reasons
They wanna see us end up like we Regina on Mean Girls
Princess or queen, tomboy or king (Yeah)
You've heard a lot, you've never seen (Nah)
Mother Earth, Mother Mary rise to the top
Divine feminine, I'm feminine (Why?)

You can edit the post to include the context, or you can ask your question as a comment below.
As an additional note:
I did a bit of digging around on the web, and I found a few sources that mention an Amy W. in the Fleetwood Mac fandom. It seems that she was a fan of the band and was close to the members. She even attended some of their concerts and was photographed with them. However, I couldn't find any specific information about why she was mentioned in a song, or what the context was.
It's possible that the line was a reference to a real-life Amy W. who was a fan of the band, but it's also possible that it was just a fictional character created for the song. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help!
Lyrics found:
I'm going to tell you a story about Amy W.
She was a young girl who was looking for love
And she found it in the arms of a man she knew
But it wasn't the kind of love that she wanted
She was looking for something more than just a one night stand
So she went out and she found a man who could give her what she wanted
But it wasn't the kind of love that she was looking for
So she broke his heart and she walked away
But she never forgot the man who had loved her
And she never forgot the man who had broken her heart
So she went out and she found another man who could give her what she wanted
But it wasn't the kind of love that she was looking for
So she broke his heart and she walked away
But she never forgot the man who had loved her
And she never forgot the man who had broken",4,2310,"Song: Everywhere - 2017 Remaster

Hey, ooh
Whoa, baby

[Chorus: ArrDee]
I don't give girls flowers, I'll give you good wood though
If you want me all for yourself, then, darling, you probably should go
There's no way I'ma stand in the rain
I can still make you say my name, say my name, say my name
Life without me might drive you insane
I don't give girls flowers, I'll give you good wood though
If you want me all for yourself, then, darling, you probably should go
There's no way I'ma stand in the rain
I can still make you say my name, say my name, say my name
Life without me might drive you insane

[Verse 1: ArrDee, ArrDee & Lost Girl]
Nah, babe, I can't make your day but I can make your night
See, I ain't the trustin' type and it's lust, not lovе
And she said, ""I'm done this time 'causе
You make love to me like I'm the one
Then run off and duck my calls for a month
Make me feel special and then like a mug
Got you up in my guts but I hate your guts""
I come back, darling, why you rantin'?
Girl, I'm single, and I always have been
Never promised you nothin' but panting
Sweating 'em plans on a late night antics
She said ""You don't show me no respect
And you're only callin' me for the sex""
At least I call 'cause the rest just all come crawlin'

Might drive you crazy, psycho
I'm wavy so I'm textin' typos
But you know what I'm on, come mine, girl
We can stay up all night 'til the light show (Come through)
She said, ""If I'm comin', I'm comin' to talk
Ain't comin' to cum 'cause I'm done and I'm bored
Not some little whore who will come anytime that you call
We ain't cool anymore""

[Bridge: ArrDee]
Ahh, tsk, why you gotta be like that?
You know you'll miss me and you'll be right back
And you're not a whore, you shouldn't speak like that
I'm nothin' but honest, you know how it is
The life that I live, I don't want a chick, I don't wanna settle
You know you're my favourite petal, but-

I don't give girls flowers, I'll give you good wood though

Living without you is driving me insane

They can't be Nicki, they so stupid, I just laugh when they try
A thong bikini up my ass, I think I'll go for a dive
His ex-bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive

Double D, big full breasts on my baby
(Yo, we going to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work
Boss ain't working you like this
He can't take care of you like this

[Chorus]
Now you're lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

[Verse 2]
Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
(There he goes, one of God's own prototypes)
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl
(Too weird to live, too rare to die)
No, I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
Nor have I ever, have I ever let you get caught?

Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low (Bitch, I ain't runnin' from nowhere)
You was never really rooting for me anyway (Ooh, ooh)
When I'm back up at the top, I wanna hear you say (Ooh, ooh)
He don't run from nothin', dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Jack Harlow]
My track record so clean, they couldn't wait to just bash me
I must be gettin' too flashy, y'all shouldn't have let the world gas me (Woo)
It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay and these girls know that I'm nasty (Mmm)
I sent her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her ass cheek
City talkin', we takin' notes
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts
Wish he could, but he can't get close
OG so proud of me that he chokin' up while he makin' toasts
I'm the type that you can't control, said I would, then I made it so
I don't clear up rumors (Ayy), where's y'all sense of humor? (Ayy)
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turned my haters to consumers, I make vets feel like they juniors (Juniors)
Say your time is comin' soon, but just like Oklahoma (Mmm)
Mine is comin' sooner (Mmm), I'm just a late bloomer (Mmm)
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter (Woo)
All these social networks and computers
Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers
[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for (I got what they waiting for)
I don't run from nothing, dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low (Bitch, I ain't runnin' from nowhere)
You was never really rooting for me anyway
When I'm back up at the top, I wanna hear you say

No one's gonna heal me if I won't be lethal

Let me keep you company
Let me be the one that understands you
I'm the one who wants to be
The hand that will hold you down, baby

All my life you were a centerfold
Ridin' so high in your silk and your pearls
I can't count all the times

Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, and the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Go and take this the wrong way
You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose

[Pre-Chorus]
Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

To somehow escape the burning wait, the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else; I guess any thrill will do

If it hurts and you can't take no more
Lay it all on me

And if you can't escape all your uncertainties
Baby I can show you how

Just remember me

And if you can't escape all your uncertainties

Sunlight comes creepin' in
Illuminates our skin
We watched the day go by
Stories of all we did
It made me think of you
It made me think of you

[Verse 2]
Under a trillion stars
We danced on top of cars
Took pictures of the stage
So far from where we are
They made me think of you
They made me think of you

[Chorus]
Oh, lights go down
In the moment, we're lost and found
I just wanna be by your side
If these wings could fly
For the rest of our lives

[Verse 3]
I'm in a foreign state
My thoughts, they slip away
My words are leavin' me
They caught an aeroplane

And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

'Cause I'm not good at making promises

And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do

And if you like goin' places we can't even pronounce

You're insecure
Doubts running through your mind
No one's gonna love you
If you won't love yourself
But when you cry
I'll be there to hold you
I'll dry your eyes
I know your fears
And I know your pain
I know your eyes
They look into mine

Than you've ever been
I can make you feel like
Nothing you've ever known

And no one will love you

No, I don't care
If nobody else believes
Cause you're perfect to me

You're like a masterpiece
You're amazing
I look into your eyes
And I see a reflection of me

Of the person that you are

Don't bring them down

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long

[Verse 1]
You, where the hell did you come from?
You're a different, different kind of fun
And I'm so used to feeling numb
Now I've got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come
Like a finger on a loaded gun

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me
Haven't felt it for a long time

[Chorus]
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long (All night long)

If I'd have known where I'd be now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Your hands on my hips
And my kiss on your lips
Oh, I could do this for a long time

[Chorus]
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long, all night long

[Bridge]
Until tonight, I only dreamed about you
I can't believe I've ever breathed without you
Baby, you make me feel alive and brand new
Bring it one more time (One more time)
[Chorus]
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long, all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long39Embed","Give the line of lyrics you'd like me to paraphrase:

That one day I will be, where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, they're much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call? (Who's to say you won't hear me?)
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, they're much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't wanna be here if I can't be with you tonight

Lay Me Down Lyrics [Verse 1]
If I believed you, my heart would be free
But I know that you'll lie, so I can't let go
It's getting hard, this fight to resist
The temptation to hold you again

I'm trying to let go, but I'm not sure how
It's killing me to let you go, but I just can't anymore

I don't wanna be left here without you

'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

And time can heal, but this won't

Just don't
