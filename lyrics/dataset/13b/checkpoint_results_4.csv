Right, I shoulda known you were bad news
From the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos
'Cause most guys only want one thing
But I'm undecided, tryna figure out if that's you
Either way though, I think you're worth a test drive
'Cause (Ooh) you're so much better than the next guy
And a little trouble only makes for a good time
So all the normal red flags be a good sign

[Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
Don't you come here thinkin' you're ballin' (Oh, nah)
Ain't down for it, you seem like trouble to me
I can tell by the way that you lean and the way that you kiss your teeth
And you turn up so fresh and clean, smells like trouble to me

Opposites attract, I guess this is that
Good girl, bad guy, what a perfect match
And if we (Ooh), you're gon' wanna pay back tithes

Oh, it's so easy loving you, girl, 'cause you make it so damn hard to resist you
Oh, give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You and I got more history than history ever did
And when you smile at me, you know exactly what I'm thinking about
It's so easy being with you, it's bringing me joy
Oh, it's so easy loving you, girl, 'cause you make it so damn hard to resist you

[Intro 1]
Please, this shit's so fuckin' hard
Helluva Beats
Yeah, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
Thirty-thousand words in a rap
That's a first, and, in fact, that's the most in the world on a track
Yeah, I've been searchin' the map
For like any other person who could work it like that
Do it perfectly slow and then perfectly fast
I'm the only one that's out here, and I'm certain of that
Play me a beat, it gets turned into ash
If I play you a beat, it gets turned into trash
Ayy, hold up, wait
When I'm on the track, I make no mistakes
I can do the shit for like thirty-thousand hours
Fuck thirty-thousand words, I don't slow my breaks
I go UK, then I make so many pounds
Everybody think I'm overweight
Gettin' bread, see me eatin'
But I gotta go in, better hold my plate
Ooh, ooh, gotta switch up
I'm so godly, I'm the bishop
Now these haters wanna link up
My bars make them get the hiccups
So I had to run it up real quick
Freestyle, gotta do some real shit real quick
Everything I do is real big
'Cause I gotta get the crowd to feel this,  real lit, real shit
Nowadays, they write me and I don't write it back
See my future demons like a psychic and a psychopath
Swear I'm drivin' down the road and I might'a crashed
Do the dash, always movin', don't know where to find me at
Hey, movin' on, gotta find a team
Earnin' all my stripes like Camilla, but I'm lima beans
All these rappers 'bout to get fucked like they Riley Reid
I'm your teacher, so be quiet or I am assignin' seats
Pioneer to the shit, Leif Eriksson
I was even hunted, 2012, like I'm Jerry Lynn
All these places got me sneezin', need a Claritin
Until I fall off next year, I'ma be arrogant
Yeah, I'm runnin' all this shit, run it up
Yeah, you know that I be comin' up for a hun'ed bucks
At the start, all I wanted was like thirty-thousand hits
Got bored, add a couple zeroes for the shits
Why not? Look what I got, look what I bought
Camera is my true eye, I'm a side-clause
Shoes, they go too high, only high-tops
Fuck yeah, I'm the new guy, what am I on?
Come in, Jaden Smith, I'm a motherfuckin' icon
Boy, I'm too cold, I don't even have on my ice on
Too lit, I don't even have the mic on
And I'm too bright, I don't even have the lights on
Better wait up
Shit's too easy, like a layup
And my bitch too entertainin'
See the note, you gotta stay up
Takin' bets on that I'll fail
It's time to pay up
Now you tryna hide your face
I'm pretty sure that that ain't make-up, uh
I'm droppin' hits and gettin' world records
Who's your favorite artist, 'cause I'm sure better?
Well, maybe not, but I tried, though
Post Malone, I go psycho
Leave you a stink, like a rhino
'Cause I rap beef, no gyro
And I rhyme fast and I rhyme slow
Turned my L's into W's; typo
Uh, hop into the track
Give you the love and you give it right back
Ten different flows I be spittin', some trap
And some other shit get in it's get on the map
Done this for like a year, and now, my writing's clear
I've been gettin' respect, 'cause now I am here
And I'm here to stay, did you hear me say
""I'm not here to play""?
""He got a flow and a voice now
I remember when he chokin' a boy out
But he's back in, showin' no choice now
Don't you know that he's gonna destroy now?""
So I'm gonna get there, and I know how
Got these beats, I be blarin' 'em so loud
When we talk about bitches and money, this shit is so funny
My parents are so proud, damn
I'm startin' to try
Tryin' the shots at it, look at the ground and see stars in the sky
Drawin' the line
All of you rappers are dizzy, I can see the stars in your eyes
You're probably high
If you think that you compare to me, it must be part of the lines
Copyin' guys
You better send all those beats back to Future, like Marty McFly
Thirty-thousand words on a track, lil' bitch
Now these people turn my vid on and react, lil' bitch
Know I got the clout, I got the stats, lil' bitch
And you givin' me a headache, where's the Advil, bitch?
But I'm doin' all I can, and I did it in the past-tense
Makin' all this money up off of YouTube, off me AdSense
Money up off of YouTube, off AdSense
All of you are wack, that's a fact, I'ma rap then
And I rap, huh, I'm a laptop
Eminem holds the world record for ""Rap God""
1.6K words
Though, we already have that topped
And we'll do it for another hour
And I'm underrated and I'm underpowered
My bars are so filthy, uh
All of y'all need to take another shower
For every fan, there's a hundred doubters
And they let me know up in the comments
But you know that we ain't done
'Cause I gotta talk my nonsense
And I gotta keep it clean, uh
Do exactly what my mom says
And I know when they headed for the top
And we still be makin' progress
I can spit bars for nine months
Then deliver you a new life
Yeah, we eatin' in this bitch, uh
All y'all better take a huge bite
And I didn't even write that shit
'Cause I freestyle, you still like that shit
See my video, press 'like' on it
That subscribe button? Better wipe that shit
I'm getting tired of this beat
I think it's time to change it
'Cause I'll spaz on trap
Old school boom-bap, you name it
Think of that as a intro
Now we get into the meat of it
This some shit you didn't see comin'
I don't give a fuck 'bout what you think of it!

[Intro 2]
Heh, ayy!
Ayy, ayy
Uh, switch up
Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2]
Look out the window, see past it, but we're faintin' reflections
You never laugh like you used to, you've got fainter expressions
You headin' down the wrong path and they changin' directions
Maybe don't mention 'bout how I made me your blessin'
And lately, I question the shit that was taught to me
I'm awkwardly stoppin' these conversations
Hey, how long you waitin' till the day you wake up and thank God you made it?
I don't like to dwell, but man, I gotta say it, don't like my songs, but you still gotta play it
Don't like your road, just N.W.A., Dr. Dre it
Stop contemplatin' and stop complainin'
And recreate it, actually, don't recreate it, be creative
Reached the place where you still vibe in that shit when we replay it
Living a life of pain just to alleviate it
When you haven't used nothing but distractions to really take it
Yeah, maybe they'll change when they see we made it
We headin' onto new platforms and leavin' the basics
[Verse 3]
Uh, my creative process is making progress
Despite my background, I haven't gotten to playin' lacrosse yet
Don't you know we got a good thing goin'?
I've been watchin' all these shows while I could be showin'
I've been creeping up on the door, so dangerous
You looking at statistics, while I figure how I'm changin' them
I done learned so many things in my past life
Now I don't give a single shit about the rap life
That's nice, ain't it? That's nice to be given advice when I paint it
Have twice much the fame, and
I can't even comprehend that much in the future
Hatin' the teacher, but you loving the tutor
Enter the game, I'm a fuckin' intruder
Stealin' these flows, man, I'm stuck as a looter
Procrastinatin' 'cause my fucking computer
No willpower, I'm just stuck as a loser

[Verse 4]
Sittin' alone at 3 AM
Chillin' on a late night is the weekday's friend
Man, this shit is too wild, I ""must behave, Ben""
That's what the teachers are preachin' to me, but even when
I'm on the top of this drop and they're rocking the world with confidence
Accomplishments topplin' everyone and you try stoppin' it?
-Obvious there's a problem, and solvin' it just ain't up to me
Luckily, I've been trained to test the system, don't you fuck with me
I hope you like my company, I hope you do appreciate it
I hope that one day, you'll see we made it
No, you cannot recreate it, all of this pain, I just alleviate it
I'm just trying to find the mindset, grinding to be the greatest
That is why I'm strivin', livin', tryin', I'm buyin'
I'm givin' dignity, cryin', I'm winnin', but feel like dyin'
I'm shining, I'm like a diamond, but I am dead on the inside
Guessin' now we'll rest with this, but set it on my big mind
[Hook 1]
And I'm in time
-Workin' all my life, get that in line
I'm tryna figure out, everyone get their pictures out
Nobody's gonna live without this shit on the incline
I'm on the incline, I'm on the incline
Stay in your lane, you got your place and I'm in mine
I'm on the incline, bitch, I'm on the incline
Nobody can really understand how my shit climb

[Verse 5]
Have I been livin' yet? Spendin' time on the internet
I'm wastin', they hatin' it, I should be makin' it, aimin' for goals but takin' this shit instead
I stay in bed, laughin' at stupid shit, ludicrous
Who is this ten-year-old pregnant with two new kids? Why am I doing this?
Why the fuck do I care? I don't, but I kinda do
I don't know what I try to do, but whatever it is, I say, ""Bye"", to you
Hey, me, I lied to you! Don't realize? Well it's time you do
You have no idea what I can do, when the skies are gray, you gotta find a blue
You gotta try to do, something to put you into a new positive mindset
Set headlines, go wreck lines, pass deadlines, leave lines dead
I guess that I digress, and I digest the way I'm blessed
Impressed after I'm pressed, you seek intent for what I said
But I'm just gonna move on, get your groove on for my new song
Do right, and you do wrong, got a big head, Jimmy Neutron
You try to hate, well, get in line, just delivered some quick rhymes
Some straight bars, we have came far, but we lookin' up on the incline

[Interlude 1]
Water break
I got a lot to say
It's been eleven minutes so far
Actually, it hasn't, it's been shorter

[Verse 6]
How can
I have a believable meaning
When all of you livin' in paradise, livin' in luxury
Nobody seen it or  greet it?
But what if it's different? I mean, it's all seeming to be
And it's in inconceivable dreaming
I know it's so unbelievable, being
Stuck in this rare unachievable feeling
They givin' me something, I ended up leaving
They givin' me nothing, I ended up grievin'
No positive side, ended up seeing
What life could be like from a  different lead in
Thank God for a cover zone
So I know when and where to cross it
All over the place
I'm surprised I haven't lost it

[Hook 2]
Yeah, ayy, and I'm feeling like I'm at the top, uh
Livin' to the max now
Yeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud
I'm steppin' up, I never back down, more focused on my background
And the music and how my rap sounds, speak up, cut the track down
Go till the end, I don't back out, stuck in the trap, figure that out
After, I'll do the math now, it's garbage, take the trash out
But I'm here to stay till I pass out, blackout

[Verse 7]
Okay, it's time to go fast
So sit back and relax, and just maybe you'll get it
About time, but maybe you're mad I said it
You gon' pay attention, cash or credit?
I have to let it go back a second
I have some lyrics in the past that I have to edit
Now we're back in the middle of the track and fed it
Mix it up and if you talk, then, nah, forget it
We moved on, walked past the exit
Want you to come back and pass a message
-Never pack bags and trash, you left it
Kinda sucks that sometimes we have to end it
Money, never am glad I spent it
If I ever had told you I'm mad, I meant it
If you ever feel bad or sad, accept it
Think back to the track and the rap that Ben did
Yeah, pretty obvious I'm killing it
If this isn't my time, then maybe you need a syllabus
I'm feelin' all the rhythm, you can tell that I am into this
Voice is more powerful than a million instruments
Suddenly, lyrics go demon, like it's somebody else
People want me to grow because of you
But I'm never going to level my endeavors to be better
Than the people that never had trust in me
Yeah, uh

[Hook 3]
And I'm feeling like I'm at the top, yeah
Livin' to the max now, uh
Yeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud
I'm stepping up, I never back down, more focused on background
And the music and how my rap sounds

[Verse 8]
Speak up, and they're messing with the track now
People are tellin' me that I'm fallin' short
Looking back at you when you're missing all the cash now
And I'm mad at the fact that
I'm not in my right mind
Meant to be a half-decent rapper
But I keep on saying all the wrong words at the right time
Lookin' at yourself, you never know what you might find
Lookin' at the sky in the middle of the nighttime
I find so much life
I wonder why I can't just find mine
Got so many confusing questions
So much knowledge, I can't use the lessons
I'm emerging out with a new profession
I'ma do the best with my new perfection
And I'm doin' it
I'm moving onto this future shit
These hooligans are complete fools in that
They just don't understand that I am through with it
Improvin' it, I'm improvin' it
I got my brain, and I'm usin' it
And I'ma make it out alive when I'm playin' and takin'
And makin' this cash, that I'm tearing these tools to bits
You're clueless
Ninety percent of y'all ignorant
Keeping your minds oh-so limited
Get off your high horse, because it is time to figure it out
Seeming so close, I can picture it now
Success in my drink, and I'm sippin' it now
Envisioning deeper ambitions, and now
I'ma get to it, that is what living's about

[Interlude 2]
Uh, God!
Uh
My voice is gone already, shit
Alright, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 9]
Think I've got a consensus, bein' lost in the trenches
Adolescent lessons expressin' God's job is to tempt us
Makin' it hard to stay alive, it's so easy to die
Makin' you hang your head low, but say, ""Reach for the skies""
Life is a walkin' contradiction, I see through its lies
I'm just tryna tell the stories I've seen through its eyes
I feel I'm forcing and feeding of off reasons to cry
With all this fake deep bullshit, I'm too eager to try
Yeah, everybody sendin' blessings in need of reply
Tryna sell their own tears, for they bleedin', they dry
Fuck your demons inside, I'm in need of the, ""Why?""
So I can summarize my life through my breathing and sigh
Like, oh well, I can say that I tried
Hopped into life and then I stayed for the ride
So many beautiful faces, but they vacant inside
And I'm just patiently waiting for the day I decide, damn
This reminds me of days when I drive in L.A.â
I'm screamin', ""Hi"" to the sky up with a smile on my face
Now I'm hidin' my face, I keep tryin' to trace
All of the steps that I had taken to findin' my place
Swept out to oceans so lonely, waves feel like an embrace
And now I'm lookin' at my mic like it's sent as a prophet
I used to be an atheist, but that turned me agnostic
Recently, I've been wondering if I've fuckin' lost it
See my friends from kindergarten go to rehab
That's the type of shit that makes you think back
To simpler times, blissfully ignorant minds
Before reality could ground us, we would live in the skies
And as a- and as a kid, I never thought I'd be bein' like this (Nah)
Man, as a kid, I never thought this would even exist
I felt elusive, intangible, just steam in the mist
And now I'm wakin' up feelin' I ain't even this shit
You only look at what you got once you see that it's lost
And life's too gradual for me to believe in my sauce
Don't understand rappers braggin', ""I got that paper on me""
Man, I got kids in schools who doin' presentations on me
So what the fuck you really value tryin' to take that from me?
To me, I'll take that over Rollies and makin' some money
Rain or sunny, I'ma do this every day, I study
And write these lyrics till my brain is fuzzy, damn
Like Tyler, Creator tweets, I just capitalize
These Romans tally up my hits with the capital 'I's
This is a natural high
I see it comin' from afar, I'm still actin' surprised, but I ain't mastered the skies
I wrote this album so much passion, I actually cried
They say 'cause I was never trappin', my rap is a lie
They think 'cause I'm a awkward kid, I'm invalid
As DJ Khaled's son receivin' a platinum plaque for bein' alive
Threw out half of my album, it wasn't good enough
Shit, I mean it still isn't good enough
I'm like a active volcano, I know I could erupt
But I guess I am not full enough, damn
I swear, the higher you get, that's the lower you feel
Man, that's more shit you gotta do, or you won't get a deal
Man, that's more shit you gotta prove so they know that it's real
Thirty seconds of listenin', thinkin' you know how I feel
Yeah, said this a motherfucking thesis statement
Yeah, came a long way, I cannot be complacent
Every day I wake up stressed, I have to be the greatest
And if not, then that's a day I truly feel I've wasted
Most of the pressure on my shoulders is comin' from me
So when I die, I know I left us with something to leave
So when I wake up in the morning with something to see
Yeah, I got so much shit that I'm wantin' to be

[Verse 10]
Benny, Ben, Benjamin, Selena Gomez has said
If you ready, come get it then, everyone is jealous-
Many want to get friends with them just in case he is relevant
Got iPhone camera lenses to get the Instagram evidence
Yeah, I know I'm way too cocky
But I'm workin', I'm figurin' it all out
So when people say you can't, that makes you wanna get better
That's benefit of the doubt
I've been on the top of this, never droppin' the bottom
It's opposite from the positives, got them from talkin' often
And I'm locked in a pocket of all my thoughts, and they keep turnin' around
Always stoppin' my songs 'cause they keep burnin' the sound, I'm like-
Yeah, this is freedom of speech
Tryna' murder all the people who be keepin' the peace
Sacrifice your whole life 'cause you need a degree
Opportunity in front of you, you need to achieve, I'm like-
Nah, I'm just tryna find some clarity
Apparently, it all has to do with popularity
There will be obstacles, primarily, people blinded to
What is carefully being prepared to me
Sometimes you'll have hilarity, parody, and prosperity
I'm askin' Hillary Clinton to marry me, powerful in the very least

[Verse 11]
Giving you all of my money, but never see legacy every day that I'm meant to see
Everyone here is impaired, it is so scary and menacing, but I know enemy
'Cause I go- uh, walking away, hopping block and what's often the case
Shot in the face, gun locked and loaded, been off at the race, droppin' the bass
Off of the place, brought in a way, predict what I will probably say
And at the end of the day, you still talking to me, so obviously, let the audience say
So let me explain this to those who came in, looking at the stages
Seeing a white kid thinking he's famous, when they don't understand
That I take risks and I make hits, from basic playlist to the greatest
Entertaining the nation, be patient whilst waiting for me to break in

[Verse 12]
-Re-energize, got lyrics to memorize
Start an enterprise of better guys who cannot be successful and never try
That's my dream job, bein' lazy, just sittin'
With the TV on, they say that I'm bright like neon
But I ain't takin' responsibility, pay me for havin'
Limited ability with little humility
But whatever I'm doin', it seems to be killin' me
I'm unwillingly artistically fittin' into this history
Tryna show you why I'm better, but none of you believe me
Tryna win this gold and try hard, good game, gg
You beat me, and now you see me in 3D, but you can't feel me
Showin' up on your device, control/option/delete
Consider myself elite, measure myself in retweets
I be talkin' way more chill so you can reach me
Instead of pretendin' you understand what I am talkin' 'bout
I'm the exhibit you kinda scared for, like a haunted house
Tryna show you something instead of just sittin' on the couch
I'll be honest now, I rarely- end up walkin' out
Into reality, in normality actually happily
Found myself doin' nothing, and you don't laugh at me, why?
'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing
Nothing 'cause for- a brain that is amazing
Not complainin', but the best part of life is not even livin' it
Love sleepin' and just usin' the internet
But my time is limited, and I better figure this
Before I'm slippin' this opportunity, out my fingertips
And let me just tell you what I have came to do
Tryna show you I can rap as fast as I'm able to
Tryna show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo
And say some stupid metaphors and leave after I'm breakin' through
And if a major record label is looking at me
I'm a nice guy with bad teeth, got a nice eye for bad beats
I can rap fast, and rap slow
I may make mistakes but everyone, has, so
I'm like MJ back when he had the afro
Also, I'm not black, so... maybe not
But before everyone gets angry, stop
I'm that person, then people naturally hate me, block
All the people who keep on going crazy off
'Cause I won't be making amazing songs in a mainstream, got
A lot of prominent features, I'm a confident speaker
With some dominant teachers
I deserve to be a starter, but constantly on the bleachers
I'm awfully small-achiever when I'm up on the spot, and eager
They be fearin' this every time that they hearin' it
To know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin' a pyramid
So when you're nearin' this, please let me know
When I'm standin' here frozen, please let it go
Hear the metronome combined in the compilation
To unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation
But that is just a dream, and probably a combination
Of a big ego and false encouragement on the way in
But when I'm playin', just know it's all a big game
I was tryna blow up- bang! Have a big name
But when you think about it, it is all insane
What can be created from chemicals in this brain
But when you look at me, you lackin' respect
When I'm crackin' my neck so that I can rap to my chest
Has in a breath, some say that it's magic, I step
Until I'm on the same stage, and you have it again
But, but when you think about the hall-of-fame
You think about how people used to sit and call you names
And you check and wonder if it will be all the same
Step back into reality, it all remains, damn

[Interlude 3]
Alright, I just spilled water on my computer right now
On my computer-'s breaking while I'm doing this thirty-thousands words shit
Hold on, uh
Goddamn it

[Verse 13]
My lyrics are not showing up on the screen, you knowin' just what I mean
This is off the top, I don't need to use no machines
Hold up, I know I can freestyle, but I can't do it forever
But I am very clever, okay, okay
I'm gonna take a drink, if you're watchin' this, take a drink too
These are some shit' that you can drink to
But drink water unless you're of age
You know what I'm sayin'? Ayy

[Interlude 4]
Okay, okay
Uh
Uh
Ayy

[Verse 14]
I feel like I'm way too different, ridiculous
-Most of humanity's made of idiots
I barely even get myself, and you thinkin' you understand?
You think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper-hand?
Please... what I do is barely poetry
There's hope for me, I'm noticing people starting to notice me
But still consider me confident
Still consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness
But honestly, all of this is haunting me, probably
It is just my sense of myself wobbling, toppling
Into awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin'
It's tragic and not fleetin', it follows me all evening
It's calling my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake
I close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away
Yeah, we're just tryna find that great escape
To get away from how we're living life day-to-day
Some people find it in a drink or in a cup
Or in some bling or in a drug, or in the things that give us love
But all I know is that it's tough
And all I know is that this stuff isn't enough; it's way too much

[Verse 15]
I'm young and ill, like the dictator, man, what I gotta do to make the quick paper?
These kid-haters are like ten years old but still claim to be big players
That shit will make me go, but I'm aiming high, and you aiming low
Got amazing rhymes and a crazy flow, and I may be lyin', but I came to show
What I can do when I get on the mic, and I'm keeping it moving, you said I'm the hype
And I'm seeing it through in successes inside, I don't take it for granted with plans in this life
-Set on the wrong, forgetting the right, like, 2 AM in my head in the lights
Ahead of the best of 'em, lettin' the rest of 'em go off to bed in the night
-Getting it like I be livin' in first class, I know that you never will surpass
-Getting the worst task for this burnt trash whenever I work fast
Remember the memos they sendin' and sendin' again and again  and they never will end it
And say it is splendid, but never relented and every sentence I say is perfected
Take a deep breath, 'cause I need that
Most of y'all don't even care what I'm saying, you really just like how I speak fast
My bars are meta, I got meta bars with meta-eights and metaphors
You want better cores and better cars, but you don't know what I'm headin' towards
Say that I am the king of this shit, crazy rhymes, they ain't thinkin' of this
I'm singin' and rappin', and makin' it happen and makin' you laugh when I'm bringin' this shit
Tryna find the other way, y'all just waiting for another day
'Cause what other fourteen-year-old had hit 100K?
I'm making the most of a crazier flow, so many ways it could go
I'm taking the throne and you chillin' and stayin' at home, I'm willing to make it my own
I'm bakin' my cake, and you know that I'm eating it, even if staying up late is the needed bit
Reason is, stayin' the same, I'm just fleein' it, leavin' my life while I'm seeing these seasons switch
Meaning, these people ain't feelin' rich, reach in the fire, I'm heatin' it
Pleasin' these liars, they've peaked, and so now they're recedin' agreein' to be a live without leading it
Flow's so dope, I think it's time that we take a break
We all make mistakes and play some hate, I got 808s here to save the day
'Cause I am on top of it, lost in my thoughts and I gotta be stoppin' it, rockin' it
You know my flow is so dominant, positive, confident, full of accomplishments, compliments
All of these offers is boring as fuck, though I am not a part of 'em
Start a new part to the charts and I gotta be sure this art is the star on the map when I'm starting it
Breaking it up, like cartilage, flow is so crazy, it's dope and you know it
I know that you hate to admit it, but really, this shit is the business, rhymes keep darkenin'
Under the radar, you don't know what's comin', I'm comin' right up, and your bitch started runnin'
I found to be part of a little of something called love, and I guess that's the art of it
I try to go slow, but it don't work
-Gettin' better, and that don't hurt, and you think I'm dead, and you're sure
You're salty and not kosher, slave to the corporates and the owners
This is live and love, call it Shrek, like the ogre
Hah, bitch, I have had enough, and I am sure I ain't mad enough
Forgettin' the rest while I'm gettin' success, and I look at the numbers, I add 'em up
My chart is like a parabola, thank you a lot for havin' us
And so, every day, I take one step up, man, I am takin' the ladder up
-Hundred K- get the plaque, lookin' forward, not heading back
Remember what I had said is that we ain't givin' up, remember that
Hit me up when you're done whining, I'll hit you up when I'm done rhyming
Listen up, 'cause I'm combining all my skills into one finding
We run, grinding, you know we do, we got the shit that we're goin' through
These lyrics go over you, you  don't listen, so you don't know it's true
'Cause we in, and we've done it, thousands, now we a hundred
Shoutout to Didac and Momo and the others
Shit, I consider them brothers, shit, I consider you all are my family
Shoutout to those who will stand with me, even when all of the others abandon me
Yeah, drama, we move past that, now I look at you with the last laugh
Better trackback, now I rap fast, so many skills in my backpack
Started off so terribly, now all of these people compare to me
In the past, I never anticipated what there would be
And see ya, so long now, off to the end of the song now
See ya next at five-hundred and a million, it's on now

[Interlude 5]
It's on now
Oh shit, I'm almost out of water
This is a hard- this a- real challenge
This like, physically difficult, ayy

[Hook 4]
When I walk up in the scene, I hear a orchestra
Now everybody telling me I don't perform enough
My math teacher told me that I'd never be shit
And now, I'm searched more then the quadratic formula
I got the formula, I got the formula
You got the sauce, but goddamn, I got the formula, ayy
People always asking Ben, ""Why you record so much?""
I got to fry up all these rappers quick, like, order up

[Verse 16]
Formula, like I'm Mr. Krabs
I change and transform it up, you stuck in the past
Yeah, I wear Supreme goggles to my science lab
Uh, it hurts to write this song, 'cause I don't like to brag
And now I've tied myself up, like a Nike Mag'
People love to criticize me for the life I've had
They make it 'bout white and black, like I'm Michael Jack'
I make these haters look confused, like it's Dora asking where Swipper at, ayy
Uh, bitch, I'm supreme, 'cause I got it on me, now they copy that, like a walkie-talkie
And I'm feelin' like they really want to stop me, tryna fold my paper, like it's origami
Wanna justify the hate, they call me cocky, and I am, 'cause your girl call me, 'Papi'
Tryna take ti-t-uh.. paparazzi, I'm a fax machine up in a lot of copies
Ayy, still saying, ""Who would'a thought?"", like, who would'a guessed it?
Haven't lifted weights in two years, but somehow, I'm always flexing
If you really want to find the answer to your question, here is where you should look:
Want the secret to the sauce, motherfucker? Better go and find a cookbook

[Verse 17]
Ayy, they doubt a fucker with a dream
Looking to the stars for some money and a scheme, yeah
Looking at the cars, all the hundreds and the greens
Serpent's told you, ""No,"" and it's like nothing's as it seems
God damn, I guess I really thought he was the man
I guess I really thought he had some fans, but that shit is all a sham
All that cash he stocked was from a scam
All the views he got was from some spam
I've been living like, ""Man, ain't why he been doin' what he can?
Why ain't he just sticking to the plan?
How has he been living with no limits, getting millions by the minutes?""
I don't get it, I don't really understand
I've been living like, ""Damn, he ain't getting money by the 'Gram
I'll do better if I study my exams, do I really wanna stand
Next to all these average fucking sad duds?""
So I hate this motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one

[Hook 5]
Yeah
Hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one
Ayy
Just because you gave up, doesn't mean I'm a backup
Uh, uh, uh
Feel all my good times get replaced by the bad ones
And so they hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he

[Verse 18]
'Cause he been living this passion, I'ma just sit and imagine
I've got a bitch on my lap and she listen to rap, and she really been digging my track, and I'm livin' for Snap
That shit invisible now, I'm unoriginal now
I'm making a- minimum wage, this is literal AIDS, and I'm needin' to figure this out
How did I get to the stage? I wanna get up on stage, do this shit everyday
And I won't care 'bout whatever they say, let 'em all pester away
But I just can't shoot my shot, got a bad gun
So I hate this motherfucker with a dream 'cause he has one

[Verse 19]
By now, if you're still watching this shit
You are a boss and you deserve some applause for this shit
But we ain't over, we ain't done, though
Am I takin' a break? Are you dumb, bro?
Well, we nearin' 10K, but I still need 30K
While all you sit around, I would rather work than play
Lyrics go through your dome, through your vertebrae
Hit you back and forth till you end up at the pearly gates

[Interlude 6]
That was actually a pretty good bar
I just wrote that like, right- a second ago, before I recorded this
Ayy, ayy
You know, just to add some- fill stuff in, uh

[Hook 6]
Sometimes, I don't know what to think
Sometimes, I don't know what'll
Make it okay, make it okay
I'm snorin' all day for dreams, yeah, ayy

[Verse 20]
Uh, I wake up pondering, damn, my mind is wandering
All these opportunities left squandered in my oxygen
All accomplishments left haunted in my lack of confidence
Often is the result of falling under consciousness
You'd make babies cry, I make crazy lives
You're just angry, 'cause you're livin' in a fading lie
And I've been feeling this energy, feeling that somebody's getting the penalty
Fearing that, one day ,you'll end up ahead of me, feeling that this is the end of me
No, will I tell you? No, never- I think I'm so clever
But in the grand scheme of things, I know that I'm no better
But I don't ever
Want to go to show, just one mo' letter
I'm a go-getter, I go get A's and get grades
And get A's, then wake up, and get C's, but get paid
Uh... my life is so unusual
To most, it isn't suitable, to me, it's irrefutable
Can't see me in a cubicle, I'd rather watch my funeral
I'd rather go back to stab my own brains out back in utero
Uh, but you know that I'm capable
You know I'ma pounce at any chance that is available
Feeling so unique and I think it's not explainable
No one hears my lyrics, and says, ""OMG, relatable!""
No, that's not what I'm here to give
Been waiting years for this, you're about to experience
Something that I've spent time, money and thought on
Learned about all the times money had thought wrong
Kinda funny, it's long gone, but time is crummy and not long
I ain't lucky, I'm not calm, not by a long-shot
-Out on the inside, see me on the outside
Always think I'm positive, and never see the downsides
It's 'bout time you know the truth, you couldn't be further from it
Get your head out your own ass, you couldn't be further up it

[Interlude 7]
Okay
Okay, okay, we're like thirty minutes in
Thirty minutes, but we got thirty-thousand, bro
Fuck

[Verse 21]
Yeah, I'm the key to the equation, bitch, you better beware
I'm like the 'e' that equals all other emcees squared
I'm just me, performing in front of empty chairs
But y'all see, so all of y'all better get prepared
I got so much opportunity, I gotta make the most of it
Shoes made of the banana peels, I feel like I'm supposed to slip
Man, in this life, we all climbing unstable ladders
It's not about who goes faster, but it's 'bout the man who'll hold his grip
Damn, I got a crazy ass work ethic
Blocked out south east and west, leave in one direction
I finished my album, and people saying they lovin' it
Fuck with it, but I took it down and redid it to perfection
We all students of rap, but we don't learn lessons
Like a Eskimo's jacket, all them be forgettin'
Wanted to fuck a nun, started like really badly
And I didn't even have to ask for me to get her blessing- that's a horrible bar
Can't stand me 'cause I crossed them up, their ankles hurtin'
Yeah, uh... yeah, yeah, I'm an amazing person
I base my motivation on my favorite angels words a-
-bout how I'ma make it, gettin' famous, man, that thing's for certain

[Verse 22]
You keep your standards low, man, I keep my standards high
Wanna' get on any action, like the Brazzers camera guy
Can't deny I'm fucking insane, sometimes I fantasize
How it would be like to be normal, but I just randomize
And analyze my situations, leaving people paralyzed
And take a step out of bed, meanwhile I'm at my paradise
America is very nice, but I'd like to see the world
But I'd like to get out in to the open and meet my girl

[Verse 23]
In a Mercedes Benz with his lady friends
Crazy Ben is just chillin' with them women, you know they be tens
They be tens or more, they be tens or more
I like to talk to all these people 'cause they marvel at my metaphors
It's free speech, I can say what I want
But these listenin' are tryna make me pay for my talk
They don't like what I'm doin', they don't appreciate the banter
I get it, you're jealous, but listen, 'cause I'm the answer, uh
Motherfucker, I'ma live for the right time
Fuck that, I'ma live for the moment
Sitting here in the middle of the night time
My mind puzzled with the thoughts that be flowin'
Damn, I've been livin' in a headache
Bitches never listenin', they saying that they ready
But I can never believe them
Got these goals and they can never achieve 'em
How can your dreams come true if you ain't willin' to dream 'em?
Damn, that's a lot of shit to think about
Suddenly, company starts to come to me, wondering
What I'm doin', next I realize, that shit, I gotta figure out
Made some beats, I gotta hit 'em out, heh
Got these dreams that I'm livin' out
In my mind's eye, givin' out lots of songs with responses
That I never pictured, wow, damn, damn
This beat's way too holy to rap over
Mental block, my mind's capacities, that's lower
Your raps slower, they lack closure, they lack substance
Like a printer without toner, y'all fillin' pages that have nothin'
Ooh, but I have got somethin' to tell you
I ain't got some money or bullshit to sell you
Speakin' from late nights, I'm thinkin' of Drake's life
Watching these interviews, thinkin' one day I might
Be on that stage right beside all these players
Shit's up to me, I won't hide it in prayers
I'll prove it in music I use to influence
I do this way harder than people assumin'
Resumin' my writin', viewin' this lightin'
That puts me to be in the view of the hidin'
I do what they're likin', but that makes 'em hate me
No matter what I do, they just mistake the
Reason I'm flowin', the reason I start up
Not just for the fame, and the money, the star bucks
And- damn, I ain't talking about the coffee place
Most to these rappers only write this shit using copy/paste
I'd have made a lot of songs that go to waste, uh
I just need a home run, I already loaded bases
I have got so many cases
Been visiting, living in so many places
Experiences that I made me to Emmy
Ben, B-E-N, please, I hope you let me
Be me, I ain't greedy or needy
Believe me, I just want to be on your TV
Get on my level, 'cause I need a new staircase
Damn, yeah, I've been looking at their space
And, one day, I'll be there
I know what I'm doin', I'm already prepared

[Verse 24]
I've been waiting like thirty-thousand years
Tryna make the world listen, so make sure that you can hear
I'm trying to take a passion out of turning my career
I'm concerned without my fear, but I earned it, and I'm here
Now I earned it, and I'm here to stay
I'm coming in, you're trying to clear the way, another chance, another fucking year to play
Not even seventeen, eighteen, I'm so near to fame
Not really, look at all the shit, I just hear this day
I don't know- I look at the future nostalgically
I'd cure every disease, and y'all still wouldn't be proud of me
Undoubtably know how to be what I am about to be
To say that money talks, and that shit seems so damn loud to me

[Verse 25]
Recently, I have been feeling alienated
My songs out of this world, people claim that aliens made 'em
But, baby, I'm crazy, don't hate me- don't hate me 'cause I'm different
Hate me because you hate me, then maybe we can live with it

[Verse 26]
People say that this is the biggest thing to hop on the screen
All will scream, overreacting, like it's a drama scene
Y'all are mean, and since the best quality is honesty
Promise me that it's the reality, where's Keanu Reeves?
Trapped in a Matrix, it's how I felt sometimes back in the ages
When I would rap on the stages, and now, I laugh at those days, and
I'm moving on, grooving while you lose the song
Move along, nothing to see here except some stupid pawns
Who could bomb this whole place up with one great lung?
One great tongue, I am that one great one
On vacation, I vacate to a location
Far away from where people just may run
A light to go to where there is no one, no one, no fun
Oh, son, I'm tryna be me, and so young
I can murder this beat with no gun, go run
I've too many problems to handle, here, hold one
I just hop onto the rap boat, but that ship has now sunks
And now, punks can make loud junk, Uptown Funk
Was a great song, catchy at first, but that radio station
Playing it, making it just get to the worst
My head's gonna burst if I hear it again, and I'm sure
I'll throw my speakers on the ground, denting the earth
And now, I'm ending this verse, and I mean it
Now the ink of this pen just keeps on bleeding, yeah

[Verse 27]
Good rappers never get to see the light of day
But when you selling sex and a gimmick, they'll sign you right away
I'll obey... nah, whatever, man, what is this?
I'm rapping so fast to the max, and I'm playing my tracks so that people will know I mean business
Nobody witness anything better than when I am showing you this shit
Know I'm suspicious, because I'll be flowing and growing like, ""Oh, this kid is big""
Know how I live it, go on a mission, y'all better listen
Till I'm ahead of this shit by all of the inches, 'eah
And when I'm, uh... I'm telling y'all that I got a story
God ignores me, stop the glory, cop is for me in auditory
Not visually, typically, the original me
So unforgivable, so inexplicable, obvious the pinnacle digitally
Damn, that was fast, felt so jammed till I unpacked
And I'm just tryna prove to you the things that I can move on the track
And I'm trying to get a record deal, never ever felt so real
Whenever we're the guests to feel, whenever f-this gets to feel
So different, and I'm loving it, time to change and discover it
Time to make a difference, and I'm living it, so I'm up for it
I always talk to them other kids, them other kids couldn't understand me
One path, making a knot, ain't gonna stop for plan B

[Interlude 9]
I wrote that one a long time ago
That was the first time that I looked- that I- I looked at those again
But you know, I still- I'm not that rusty, not that rusty
I- actually... classic!

[Verse 28]
We just living in the solar system
One big world here to hold the wisdom
One big jail to control the victims
We're all here, tryna find a soul in rhythm
A voice in writing and a choice deciding
Whether or not to follow what the boys are likin'
What the girls are doing, what we gotta be exposed to
Think about who you are, and it's so true
Think about the people who you think have really known you
Do they really know you? Do you even know you?
Damn, that shit is like a Jaden Smith tweet
Sometimes you gotta think 'bout how crazy shit be
And lately, it seems to make the extremes
So prominent and dominant in making big dreams
I'm seeing aliens scream
When I go to sleep, man, my brain needs fixing
But I'm just tryna make it in life
Fuck you to people who be saying it like
I ain't making it right? Take a vacation and hike
I'm chilled out, bitches, getting famous despite
The fact that I'm young and little bit nerdy
And I know a lot of people would consider me early
I'm just a little kid working tryna configure my searches
Tryna deliver my purpose, and take a shit on my burdens
I'm just me, no, I ain't a victim to hurting
I just see all the people living and burning
So be free, time to be a little bit nervous
It don't matter if you're scared, 'cause this shit is disturbing
And I get it, I don't wanna ever forget it
Guessin' I'm headed towards the ending, and I know it is splendid
So I'll see ya 'round, underachievers
Hop on my wagon, 'cause we dragging late, we gotta be leaving, man

[Hook 8]
So basically, I do this for fun, they ain't making me
I'm tryna have a blast, 'cause we growing so fast, we be getting my career from A to Z
And, basically, I'm great you see, I made my life at the age of three
But now, what am I meant to do when my own fanbase are hating me?

[Verse 29]
I've been see' 'ple- misusing their fans, like crooks
Manipulating their audience to catch that hook
They'll believe anything that you'll tell them, look-
You can feed them shit so you can sell your book, haha
But no shots fired, though
Nothing wrong with a little bit of lying though
I mean... look at Fox News
That's the whole premise of their entire show
But no political shit, I always do just enough, I'm a minimalist
Makin the most of my minimums, winnin' 'em, got a couple of synonyms to help you listen to original bits
I got a lot of digital prints, man, your own homedog is a literal bitch
But I'm filling the syllables, it's a little predictable, 'cause I've written this shit for all of the cynical kids
I got time! Maybe a little too much of it
But you know that I'm tryna move up a bit
People look at me and say my potential has
Got a big max, and you know that I'm lovin' it
So fire, can't handle me with oven mitts
Underground, blessed if you discovered it
Flow is so unique, I got so much to do
Not like any other kid

[Hook 9]
Ayy, yo, what you say, though?
Yeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, though
Yeah, when I walk out in the town, I gotta stay low
You know I'm comin' to them checks like Usain Bolt

[Verse 30]
Wait so, inhale the fumes while I paint this
Picture: me, I'm sitting in my room and I'm anxious
Tryna make my moves while they huge and they famous
I knew this shit I couldn't do, I was jaded
Now, somehow, I'm next up, yeah, I'm blessed up
Now I wake up and I'm fly, I don't dress up
Now I'm fly and my opponents better catch up
I get my checks, uh, all y'all need to step up
I-I-I-I-I-I- remember tryna practice my cadence
In tracks I was makin', I had to be patient
Everybody said that shit was trash, and they were right
But I turned that shit and made a right, shit is day and night
Now I gotta take a flight to Vegas, might not stay the night
Everybody see me eatin', now they wanna take a bite
So I'm like, ""Okay... no way""
Yeah, when it comes to this shit, man, I don't play
I'm like Houdini in my Ghost, you can't see me, I'm gone
Ball so hard, I gotta wear my Yeezys to prom
YouTube bitches asking me to retweet they song
I'm the reason people got Spotify Premium on

[Hook 9]
Like, ayy, yo, what you say, though?
Yeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, though
Yeah, when I walk out in the town, I gotta stay low
You know I'm runnin' to them checks like Usain Bolt

[Verse 31]
So I'm like okay, nah, no way
When it comes to that shit, man, I don't play
If you ask me how I got it I will say
I got the drive, yeah, really get out of the roadway, uh

[Interlude 8]
Damn
Some of these
Are too slow and also too fast
Whatever

[Verse 31]
I'm out of order, three hoes like I'm Santa Claus
Pull up on your bitch, Bape hoodie with a camouflage
Hey now, yo, what's the play now?
I'm tryna slide, I ain't talkin' 'bout a playground
Yeah, I remember all them days I would stay down
20K's chillin' in my PayPal
So what the fuck you wanna say- you wanna say now? Nothin'
Best in my town and that's no discussion
Humble beginnings, ain't humble, we winnin'
If I wanna brag, that's my humble decision
Everything I do is goin' off
So if I wanna freestyle, then you better know the cost, ayy

[Interlude 10]
I think she blocked me
Damn
There's no more water, I'm literally about to die

[Hook 9]
I think she blocked me on the Instagram
I need to know, what did I do? I guess I missed your plan
Me, I'm just searchin' for that truest shit, where is it, man?
I'll never know, just wanted you to help me understand
I need some closure because, truthfully, I give a damn, I give a damn
Plenty of fish in the sea, but see, I ain't no fisherman
See, I'm a middleman, a businessman, and this means business, man
Diggin' in the sand, lookin for a reason, I'm not kiddin', man

[Verse 32]
How am I gonna let all of this get to me?
Been a few months since you texted me
Shit, I'll just tell myself I'm a celebrity
Ain't no way that this can get to me
And in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter
But right now, it's feeling like everything
The more I talk about it, it just gets sadder
'Member thinkin' about a wedding ring
But now I'm thinkin' 'bout so many things
What did I do to deserve it?
This shit the most petty of petty things
I'll stick with how nobody's perfect
Like all of my life, I'll forget about it
And all of the things that I said about it
But why the fuck did I get blocked?
I just cannot wrap my head around it

[Interlude 11]
I just can't wrap my head around it
Now I'm just getting bored, I'm just fuckin' up all the flows
Just for the fun of it
If you're still watchin' this shit, uh, comment, uh...
Comment ""Arrowhead water"" in the comments
And let me know what-what would you rate this out of ten
Give me a rating, that way know that you're real-
That you're real one, you know what I'm sayin'? Alright, here we go

[Verse 33]
Spectacular speculations
-Havin' some reservations
Imaginin' all the statements
-Travellin' through these places
Back in, then buy some passionate
Trashin' of reputations
They actually don't have facts, and
Reality left them baseless
I wish that we left 'em nameless
-'Sociate 'em with faces
Make judgments from expectations
And watch as their heads are shaking
-People want me to crumble
And turn to some medication
To fuck up my motivation
And focus on education

[Hook 10]
But I'm petty, petty, petty, petty
That's all they really ever tell me
So many times that you convince me of shit
That I swear you could've won an Emmy
I got a phone in my hand, like a note for the 'Gram
And I'm thinkin' about holdin' your hand, but you don't understand
I think t' 'ove is eith-either gold or a scam
And you never really know till the end, like, how all this began

[Verse 34]
I've been comin' at this as a man
Trying to figure out where I fit into the plan
How does all the drama surround me? I hear 'em followin' loudly
And I don't wanna hear about this shit again
I guess that's the way it goes when they stalk me
And do anything to try and stop me
I did nothing wrong, but that's how it goes
When a basic bitch try to block me, uh

[Verse 35]
Livin' life, but you're stayin' the same
How you expect yourself to go take the fame
Make your name, but you don't take the pain
You wanna be unique but not make a change
Like, what? How you expect to go through this
Think about the goals, man, why you wanna do this
So stupid and useless if you never lose it
Risk yourself a little for the movement- when did I write-
This ain't the Ode to Joy, this the ode to success
Don't know if there is a God, but I know that I'm blessed
And I'm open to ""No"" and I'm open to ""Yes""
I'll do whatever I can to go to the best
That will go to the right and go to the left
No doubt I'ma show up at night instead of goin' to bed
When I know that I'm right, I'm explodin' my chest
I keep on loadin' the time and it goes over my head
I think ""No, why do I even try these things?
I need shiny things like diamond rings
And flying rings and pricey bling- uh
That is what drives these strings
I'm so- I'm so lively and lazy at the same time
Sayin' somethin' sane and crazy in the same rhyme
Never go to practice, don't phase me till it's gametime
Learnin' this life will amaze me, how I made my
Day, find a minute, I'm livin', winnin' and willin'
To spit rhythm and chillin', they get so pissed with me, I'm either villain
No, they not kiddin', and no, I'm not quittin', I know I'm just sittin'
Sittin' with a dream, and maybe
Maybe just see then, see then where the dream could take me
But I know it can't, I know it takes luck, I'm angry!
Why am I just the B of the A-team
At the feet of the mainstream? Man, I dream for this daydream!
Uh, and I believe that I'm makin'
Cease for the takin', it's me in the train, and
I see that I'm breakin', my knees aren't place and
I keep on thinkin' that I'm being amazin'
But I'm improvin', I know it's just a slow climb
Pushin' myself, yeah, I'll be there in no time
So I'm movin', I'm movin' till I get there
Get where? I just don't want to get left there

[Interlude 12]
I don't remember
I don't even know what that's from but that was written in there
It's been a lot of late nights, okay?

[Hook 11]
I don't give a fuck about anything
Skinny white child on the track, but I'm threatening, they don't wanna let 'em in
They told me if I take it, I'll feel better, like it's medicine
But I ain't settling, they tryna rush me, like adrenaline

[Verse 36]
And labels don't reply so I can get a deal
I've been itchin' for this shit, someone give me a Benadryl
I get hella skill, man, they worried that I never will
Have success in bills, man, the grill- haha seven mill'
I don't give a fuck about this shit, I've been goin' overboard and now they jumpin' on the ship
Man, they hypocrites, pimpin' they butterflies while they in- okay, that one was work, uh
And want my Christmas as a Christmas gift
Middle child, know I'm anythin' but in the middle, bitch
Man, I don't give a shit, I'm well behaved, and so articulate
I'm the type to ask my fucking teacher for a syllabus
Uh, uh
Existential crisis, every day I think I don't exist
Chicken little, I'm a fryin' pan, I'm a dyin' man
Wake up every mornin', I'ma make a fuckin' diagram
And find a plan to be the highest man in this giant land
Rap so fuckin' hard, I think I'm injurin' my diaphragm
Iron Man, think I'm Iron Man
Kids be puttin' fire emojis on my entire 'Gram, I'm a fireman
Second grade teacher got me singin' in the choir, man
And look at where I am, I never thought I would acquire fans
Acquire bands, say a bunch of random shit and rhyme it, man
That's how much I do not give a fuck, let's go to Ireland
Hundred grand on those rubber bands to hold your fuckin' bands
Listening to the cash register like your fuckin' jam
-Don't understand, like a Republican with a gun in his hand
Sayin' that ""Trump is the man to come with the plan"", livin' in wonderland
That shit is a fucking scam
Making America show that it's dumb again, ha! Ha...

[Verse 37]
They told me I needed to do a switch up
My friends told me I needed to get my hits up
It ain't that simple, I'm not someone that white teenagers wanna be like
I can't say ""Issa"" in a meme and have it pick up
Big up, I'm a transnational British person
Dimension C-137's my biggest version
I've been disturbin', music it isn't listed as urban
Air quotes next to my name in red caps, written as burden
I'm a fuckin' burden to every fuckin' person on this Earth, man
I'm determined, I'm tryna get it workin'
Sortin' out pins and needles like an amateur surgeon, that makes no sense
All these listeners are so dense
This song is conversational, so why you still talkin' to me?
I email artists, they haven't responded to me
My camera just went out, so why you still talkin' to me? Uh
I'm trying to give you free money, not fond of your feat
I'm tryna to make a deal, not call the police
I have free publicity, they don't want to be seen
I guess they don't wanna be seen, fuck these monopoly scenes
Uh, yeah, they collab with rappers with fifty plays
I hit 'em up about it and wait sixty days
Now I'm bigger than these rappers I'm askin'
I hit 'em up again, and then I never get a response, damn
What the fuck is happenin'? Damn

[Hook 12]
I said f-
Fuck a lawsuit, fuck a lawsuit, ayy
What'd it cost me is what it cost you, ayy
G-Gotta stop you, y'all are not cute, uh
No need to argue, 'cause I do not lose, ayy, uh

[Verse 38]
Who's your momma? I need to know who taught you, I need to
'Call you believe, but I'm sure that nobody believes you
I'm makin'-I'm makin' music, as soon as I start makin' money, you tryin' to review
You gonna claim every verse on my album, are you gonna claim these too?
'Cause I am independent, you a little jealous, and you skeptical of how I'm really sellin'
You assumin' that I can't legit defend it, I'ma send you out here with a prison sentence
Copyright-abusin' pricks, tryin' to profit off my music shit
Little do you know that I am not afraid of you, and so I will refuse to quit, you stupid bitch
I'm bad for real, my shit got mass appeal, ayy
Every song that I drop is an anthem, you don't really have to kneel, damn
Freestyle, you don't have to steal, don't like it? Well, you have to deal, damn
If I say it that it's how I feel, it's real, I don't pass no drill, damn
Plug called like we had a deal, man, this shit ain't daffodils, damn
When it all comes d- at my door, get the fl- 'oy like a Happy Meal, ayy
If it does, then I have to kill, name a track like the- you pass a d'ill-
Haha, to 'hi-, killer, bum-uh-dum-num, damn, I have to chill
Yeah, this a new wave, y'all are too late
You say you gon' start tomorrow, well, tomorrow's today
I get-I get all these bags, stuff 'em in a suitcase
You a thief, you be stealin' flows like you Boonk Gang

[Interlude 13]
I accidentally quit out all these lyrics
So I was just trying to piece it together like a puzzle
You know what I'm saying? Ayy
Let's gom random shit, ayy

[Verse 39]
I take no credit for anything that I do
That's how I live life with a positive attitude
That's why I've seem pissed, but I'm never gettin' mad at you
That's the reason that people mirror my attributes
What I contribute to the world is
Some crazy shit nobody else's world did
And I'm just tryin' to spread some peaces love
But, man, it's really hard, 'cause you need some luck
I've been waitin', 'cause this is
The best time for me to be layin' out of business, uh
And I'm breathin' in the air, but it all tastes tainted
When all of this time is wasted, really ain't wasted

[Interlude 14]
This is trash, I have- don't know when I wrote this
I think I wrote this in like 2013, this is how far back I-
This is how far back we are, I'm not even gonna rap this
Let's do something else- oh, okay, let's do this

[Verse 40]
It's bumpin', bumpin', this beat is just so disgustin'
You leavin' me in the lust of my meet-and-greet for my lovin'
I'm enchanted, damn, this beat is just full of somethin'
That's makin' me want to get up, and breath in all the percussion
Man, I'm dancing, dancing, man, I'm feelin' the rhythm
Droppin' my head, fancy snares, then when it hits 'em
It really gets in my bloodstream, life just makes sense to me
Bass and a good groove is really a great recipe
Can't mess with me, no one- feelin' too good in the moment
Feelin' new when I go in, and feelin' blue when it's over
And I'm noddin' yes, and then I am applaudin' next
And then, I'm tryna to mentally send God a text
Like, ""Hey, what's up, God? I don't know if you're real
But, listen to how this bumps, you supposedly feel
Like a godâ well, you get what I'm sayin'?""
And goddamn, I just can't really express when I'm playing

[Hook]
I said it's bumpin', uh- y'all just go for a ride
We feelin' good at the top, man, we more than high
Yeah, we be feelin' it, know that this the realest shit
All the pain, this is healin' it, love it, I'm never leavin' it
It's bumpin'

[Verse 41]
Really, this is bumpin' to me
You ain't feelin' it, so then you just get up and you leave
But this is something to me, so don't come runnin' to me
I said we comin' in this shit like we be fuckin' the dream
No, never mind, probably not
But I constantly got energy that's lost in my thoughts
And I'm not gonna stop, and yes, this may be costing a lot
But lookin' at the end result, man, we've accomplished a lot
And no, I'm not gonna regret a thing after this, I'm still trying to master this
'Cause now, I'm known as that weird-ass rappin' kid
The fact of it is that it is really just a giant hobby
Something for me to be original, not a lyin' copy
Tryna make some shit where you can really get your head nodding
Verses so fire that- 's when it's done, it's- left sobbing
Blah, blah, blah, it's uh- we just a work-in-progress
Some of my shit means shit and other words are nonsense
But now we easin' up, we got a beat that's bumpin'
See me stuntin' while I'm flowin', we adjustin', see me bluffin'
Every day, man, see me bluffin', that is what I do
Listen to some good shit, tryna make a substitute
I got so much stuff to do, and I am just a youngin' too
Who just hopped on the scene? Everybody wonders who
But all I know is that we find a safety in rhythm
And that is the reason that I am making a shipment
I said it's bumpin'

[Interlude 15]
Nearin'- we're nearin' an hour
If you're still watchin' this shit, I love you, I actually, like, love you
Long time, okay

[Hook 13]
I said, I'm married to the game, but I only just met her
Hopin' that my shit get better, but I'm just gonna
Move with it, ride with it
It's my life, the only burden is the time limit
Fuck it, I'm livin', ayy, I said, ""Fuck it, I'm livin'""
People getting mad, just because, yeah, I'm winnin'
Just because, yeah, I'm winnin', they're stuck-up, and I get it
Just because your life stucks, stop corrupting mine with it
I messed-I messed up the punchline, it's actually really good
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, ayy
Ayy, ayy, uh
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, uh

[Verse 42]
And how am I meant to keep my workflow up?
If a girl shows up, all my world blows up
I'm just sittin' and waitin', instead of becomin' the greatest
Tryna find a brand new motherfuckin' deal
All you bitches fake, all my numbers real
All my shit is punchin' in your stomach, like a meal
Am I married to the game if I can't afford a ring?
It's all very much the same if I can't afford to sing
Now, it's scary for a king, damn, I said, it's scary for a king, even
They call me odd, but I bring even
I bring reason to believe, and you're eatin' it up for free, and
The meaning is rarely seen and no line can be drawn between 'em, I don't show seasons
Yeah, I am me no matter what, and that can grow pleasin'
I'm barely close to anybody, I don't know people
Man, I don't know people who so equal
I don't know nobody who doesn't own evil
Man, that is just a truth and a lie
A truth and a lie, somethin' like the blue in the sky
Or a suit and a tie, yeah, I'm new to this life, I'm new to my mind
New to the time, man, I'm like the proof in disguise
And uh, I'm- lookin' at all of this shit
Oh, you should know I'm not fallin' for this
You get discouraged for one minute
And the next one, you be callin' it quits
And I'll probably get rich If I focus enough
You close-minded, let's open it up
And all of these people assumin' 'bout what I be doin'
But they do not know what is up
Uh, I just wish
That they'd go away
And I won't obey
No, I will never ever show the way
And I will try to mask it up
With other jokes on fucking jokes
Always playin' G'
But now I'm movin' onto other notes

[Interlude 16]
My voice is fucking hurting
It's hurting a lot, I'm not- I haven't had vocal training
So I don't know how to- just do this for a long period of time
Without causing damage to my vocal cords, but who gives a fuck?
Man, I just live it up
I'm gonna go a little bit quieter now
Uh-huh
Yeah

[Chorus 1]
All of these people keep on changin'
All of these times and different phases
All of these lights on all these stages
All of these sights is so amazing
Yeah, I've seen at least a million faces
A million times, a million places
But when it's all said and done
I look and I wonder why, uh

[Verse 43]
Everyone knows that it's so amazing
All the support is my motivation
Compared to the big people at the Capital
My name is spelt in lower cases
People loved me before I made it
People liked it before they watched it
I'm wantin' way too much more than I have
And I'm glad, because now, I will never stop it
Man on a mission, and I g- vision
Of talking a lot of wisdom, man, I gotta listen
Gotta follow and be the leader, and tomorrow
I'll be the teacher when they need the feature
Got flow, and it's so damn crazy
People consider me so amazing
I'm holding control and then folding them verses
It hurts because I am on loaded bases
Advanced shit, I know the basics
Already know them, they're overrated
Meanwhile, I am not rated at all, so we hopin'
'Cause now I am open for game, and
I'm charged up
I ain't Drake, but I'm on the worst behavior
So many people they know the players
Don't know the game and don't know the makers
Don't know the fakers, but who cares?
I'm not here to cater, I'm here to improve and show that I'm greater
I'm here to go move and just go on the layers
And bitch, I am going so later
I got time
My own lyrics, I got mine
And I'm on time for the wrong lines
And I'm not crying, so let's start grinding, let's go

[Hook 14]
I've been all on my own
All on my own, people keep calling my phone
Wanting to know when I'll be the star of the show
But I'm all my own, yeah
And I don't want to talk about it, stop to doubt it
'Cause the world is awfully crowded, but-
The ghost of me is haunting the throne
So I'll make it there all on my own

[Verse 44]
My intermission is mixing with intermissions
And following intuition conflicting with my decision
And it is more than just business, 'cause this is for self-approval
And it is to make it look like I'm living for something useful
And it's sad, but you know it's true for most of you
Appearances distracting from the goals that you should go pursue, the growing movement
To a new type of thing that you can gain from
To push away the past and the places that you came from
Day one for me was like six months ago-

[Interlude 17]
Oh, holy shit!
I actually reached the end of the beat
But I still have, like
Ten-thousand more words
Hold on, I gotta pause this
Hold on, three, it's still one take

[Verse 45]
-Past and the places that you came from
Day one for me was like six months ago
Look at where we been, but imagine where one can go
It's not fun to know that we just livin' to die
It's not fun to know that we just livin' to die
We now know how much money you can give for a lie
Give for a look, but how much can you give for an eye?
What's the point of feeling shit if you just living to cry?
So, get your ass up, 'cause it's time to make it happen
Always been shitty at rappin', but I practice for the passion, man

[Hook 15]
Yeah, I've been living life all on my own, bitch
Uh, I ain't the star of the show, bitch

[Verse 46]
I know like four people who truly respect the grind
And it's usually left to climb in a newly perfected rhyme
And then if time is money then free time ain't really free
And all my fan' pissed 'cause my own lyrics ain't really me
-Stemming from a branch of a wishlist on my Christmas tree
I want to be what's taunting me, but sorry, I'm a mini-me
In the face of my full potential, that is the biggest me
Bigger than you, bigger than anybody in history
The challenge is a challenge, the fact that you got to maximize
To satisfy your lavish life and have a crazy magic time
And luckily, I'm so damn young, 'cause, man, I have the time
To learn from my mistakes and grow into a mastermind
I'm trying to master my craft, and the problem is that I've got
Several different things to potentially make my job
I want to make the MLS, and also have a mili' subs
And also get a mili' plays, and maybe make a mili' bucks
A million- shit, all we ever want is more, really
And once I get three million, I want four milli'
It's so silly, it's so tricky, this whole cycle
We can never be happy, but that is so vital

[Interlude 18]
Uh
Those are actually some good lyrics, uh

[Verse 47]
Rebirth, feet hit the earth, my knees hurt
They're weaker than previously, her
Breathing seems to be burnt like free CDs were
Before we could be searched, I'm like ""Please, just please work""
Like a lenient slave ownerâ that's edgy, like gravestones, oh, you get me
I saved dough for a Bentley, t'ere more than a Chevy
I play- I play-
-Who cares about flexin' if you ain't holding it heavy?
Uh, I've been tryin' to prove to all of the people I knew who didn't like what I do
Disgusted like, ""Ew"", yeah, this shit goes outta you, plans have now all become true
I'm seeing them through, man, that's the reason I do, all of the things that I do
It's not for a crew, not for a god or a demon, I've really been needing a clue
Fillin' these shoes, reading these pieces and news, damn, this shit really is screwed
It gives me the blues whenever I'm shielding my eyes from the darkness and don't get a view, uh
But if ignorance is really bliss, then why this ignorance be killin' kids?
And why this ignorance that's clearly vicious is not given shit and ends up innocent?
That shit really is ridiculous, it's magnificently fucked up
But nobody wants to tough it up, I haven't seen it goin' down, it's comin' up
Lâ

[Verse 48]
âcay to the Vatican, havin' them
Good times and bad times with New Romans, do that again, well, that was when
I was so young, too young to really know fun
But so what? I guess that's what happens when you grow up
Dry your eyes and wipe your nose up
Just keep drinking till you throw up, no, we won't judge
But we all just want to be loved and somehow get validated by those we hate
Such a twisted system that we've been given to operate
I've been really thinkin' and figurin' out who's not a fake
Wash away the thoughts I made along the way, it all has changed
Yeah, and now we lookin', it's so far away
And it's so far away

[Hook 16]
This a civil war
It's a fuckin' civil war
Yeah, we be aimin' to the peace
So what we killin' for?
Yeah, anymore
What we even livin' for?
Yeah, they be murderin' for peace
That is a civil war

[Verse 49]
You know- you know they be lookin' at me right now
Like the sewer system, they about to pipe down
I've been writin' my essays, my webpage
Yeah, I call that a new construction site now
Blue's Clues, man, I think I gotta find out
All these questions, man, I really wanna hide out
Or I wanna drop out, maybe learn a lot 'bout
My shit before I wait to see it die out
Damn, I-I just wanna go along
I'm holdin' strong, I know- I know I'm not the boldest one
I'm old enough, I'm growin' up, bars so sick, they throwin' up
They know what's up, now, I'm in the- now I'm really doin' the
Doin' in the big leagues like I got drafted
Before the year-round hype over March Madness
Wanna get it to where these girls strippin' down
Like it's no big deal, like we takin' liberal arts classes
They be sayin', ""Damn, Ben really got savage""
No, but unlike you, I am not average-

[Interlude 19]
Hold on, I have to fix this fucking instrumental
This is so mental, hold on, I have to fix it real quick
I'm gonna fix it, take a pause
Uh, yeah, ayy

[Verse 50]
I'm addicted to the screen and the validations
Of people who are thirteen in another nation
I've been looking for acceptance in the message
Or a comment on a video, it seems to be wasted
Like Internet track meets, they erased it
Look at this shit, I've just recently made it
That how it goes when I'm beatin' and breathin'
Acheivin' and keep on succeedin', they hate it
Y'all lousy and can't breathe all that smoke, bro
You doubt me, but you'll see where I go, so
Allow me to break free from my own dome
To get out and be me, believe in my own zone
Things become intense in the heat of the ozone
It's surroundin' me, I need to go home, so
Can I pretty please just be al-alone?
Nobody to retweet, delete on my home phone
I ain't gon'-I ain't gon' hop on that drug shit
When they all claimin' they love it, uh
I ain't gon' hop on that loud shit
When I know I ain't about it, uh
Yeah, they cannot take this away now
They have something to say now
You cannot order this shit on a takeout
All of these bitches is fake now

[Verse 51]
âMy clothes is Japanese, I wear it casually
And I'm a killer on the mic, might cause a couple casualties
-All I'm needin' is a beat to make your fuckin' salary
Man, I said, ""Fuck the peanut gallery, I got a fuckin' allergy""
Trappin' out my PayPal, make it Friends and Family
Now I'm so hot, I need some oven mitts, ain't safe to handle me
Now I made my checks from Spotify, they pay me handsomely
I got the mic up to my brain to help maintain my sanity, okay
Everybody 'round me, they been wasting my time, ayy
Pull up to the functions, see they face when I rhyme, ayy
Everyone's a critic on my case all the time
Do it by myself, I don't need a way to get signed

[Hook 17]
Bitch, I'm clouted up, yeah, I'm clouted up, ayy
Get my numbers up, gotta add 'em up, ayy
Until I get it, I ain't never packin' up, no
And they all comin' for my blood like Dracula, ayy

[Verse 52]
Okay, I'm backin' this, not maskin' shit, now everybody wanna go package shit
I don't give a fuck, you know I'm abstinent, I'ma fuck the whole game up on accident
Wait a minute, shit, I'm too passionate, so they stand up for my anthems, no Kaepernick
'Member when they used to all laugh at this, now they hit me up like, ""What the fuck's happenin'?
Yeah, I had to sacrifice a lot of sleep
Because a lot of people want a lot from me
Yeah, standing in the way of who I wanna be
Now random strangers recognize me when I cross the street

[Verse 53]
So many memories, do you remember these
Moments way back in the time?
Trapped in the back of my mind
I am so happy to grind, I am so happy to find
So much experience now that I'm passing the lines
Now that I'm grasping the signs
I have been laughing a lot, got nothing to hide
No, I've got nothing to hide
Bitch, I am stuck, left behind
I need a drive, yeah, I need something to ride
Fill my own bank account, shit that I'm making now
Puttin' it off to the side
Feeling alive, yes, I am breathing the air
And I'm feeling so careless, but I can't
Let go
Damn
Every morning
I'm wanting to drop out
But I can't stop now
I put too much work in this shit to go pop out
So I walk down five different paths every day
Just need the one, it's only begun
No, I'm not going away
No, I'm not gonna- 's uh- say
That this shit is going badly at all
I'm glad that I fall
I love the ref, but I am mad at the call
I'm mad at the call
Yeah, I'm having it all, I'm traveling far
And I'm practicing hard
Never goin' back to the start, never goin' back to the start

[Verse 54]
Uh, yeah
Putting my mind on the table
No, I am so able, I'm lining the cables
I got the horsepower, but tied to the stables, get by with no label
I do the mixing and mastering
Writing and rapping and making it happen, I'm
Eating my cake, and I'm having it
Real emotion, I'm tapping in, passionate
And I am working my hardest
It's already started, yes, I am being an artist
I'm feeling the largest
I'm feeling the largest

[Part III]

[Intro 3]
Oh!
Is that the final beat change up?
Alright, we were on that last beat for like an hour
For lit- literally an hour... um..
But you know what? Gotta hop on this classic beat, ayy
Uh
Yeah
Had to change it for all you that have been watching till
Till the end, you know?
You didn't think that beat was ever gonna change, but it did, though
Uh, yeah
Ayy

[Verse 55]
Recently, I've been feeling my lyrics missing meaning
I'm trying to whitewash how much they stink like I'm Listerine-ing
Damn, I'm feeling like I've missed the key, and
So I guess that DJ Khaled is always skipping me
But, yeah, you know I'm tryn  do what I can
But these ignorant idiots just can't understand
Yeah, you know I'm tryn  do what I can
But these ignorant idiots just can't understand
I got new crews and the new friends, got new views in a new lens
I'm the new dude, I'm the new Ben, got my YouTube with the new trends
But the way I'm growing is so unorthodox
How could I be connecting them if I have yet to sort the dots?
Sorta lost and very found at the same time
I pour the cost, now I'm very loud in a daytime
And very quiet at night- seem to shine when I write
And I'm longin' to be a five-year-old, chillin', flyin' a kite
And I admire the sight of somebody else workin' more than me
I've been staying grounded, but the sky is movin' towards my feet
And fortunately, I'm on course, living morally
Grinding to get what's rightfully mine, I'm headed right for my dream
Damn, I guess that's all I need to know for now
They put me in the driver's seat, no way I'm slowing down
They know me now but don't know my sound, it is so profound
Give m- two years and I'll make it, let me show you how
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 56]
I gotta stop all of this bragging shit
So many haters, S.M.H. is the acronym
I'm tryna get a couple ""OMG""'s
Or a, ""WTF, he is so sexy""
I got no Bentley, beat is so deadly
Walked up to the rap club, no entry
And I feel a little like I won't get seen
'Cause I'm so white, won't fight, don't get me
'Cause I'm coming at this music with a different set of ideas
Trying to bring my own crib like it's Ikea
Here's a pro-tip: take no tips
From people who aren't pros yet, bitches always so stressed
Damn, 'cause they trying to find that great escape
Nation of dreamers who all just trying to stay awake
Every day, I be waking up to my 808s
Day-to-day hustle, I'm just trying to pave a way
People with the problems always give the most advice
Like, why don't you sort your own life? Don't come close to mine
I'm mostly fine, so please leave me alone to whine
And next time that you're talking shit, please bring me an open mind
'Cause people locking they own ideas in straitjackets
I'm David Blaine's magic- helping you break past it
I'm trying to raise havoc, not trying to stay savage
Trying to make balance while finding a great passion
Climbing to get up this- witnessin' injustice
By who people in love with or based off of skin colors-
Shit is so disgusting- seeing it in public
I'm trying to make sense of it here in the discussions-
Close my eyes and go to sleep, waiting until they notice me
Wait until my creations are making everything so complete
My thoughts are scattered- find lots of patterns
I try not to let it get my plots in ashes

[Verse 57]
I don't ever think I've- some money, some- little talent
These rappers' shows look like lip-sync battles with Jimmy Fallon
What really happened? I'm jealous if people selling platinum
Worst year of my life? That's like saying the worst Kendrick album;
It's way better than average, I'm already established
Unforgettable classic, y'all shit is set to go plastic
They want to see me disappear like incredible magic
Your regrettable attitude is upsetting my passion
I'm getting listens and play, fuck all the simpler days
I just took a moo- mon- break- I got Spotify paying me minimum wage
I'm like that's good enough, man, I've been eating, ain't full enough, I just want to make it pulling up
I've been putting up with all of these amateurs, sure enough, I'ma show 'em how it should be done

[Verse 58]
I got green and I want beef like a omnivore
I got that exclusive flow that can't be bought at stores-
All this new shit, they still be wanting more
They say that my duty is not fair like some modern war
I'm stacking rolls, just like the Michelin Man
Eating sushi every night, but I don't live in Japan
Damn, I'm trying to get as many hits as I can
And like a lazy-ass beaver, I ain't giving a damn
Woah, this shit is corny, you really gonna ignore me?
You really gon' let it slide when these Benjamins do adore me?
And as we rise, man, it ain't about fame and fortune
We got a greater importance, that's why I wake in the morning
I'm tryna play a performance- make a change with a chorus
I came from a tiny platform, but now my stage is enormous
Flawless, do anything to stay out of office
'Cause I'm cautious, not gonna sell my soul for the profits

[Verse 59]
Yeah, I got many dreams, lot of passions
I'ma get there by any means, just imagine
Just know that anything can happen
Take chances, put everything in rapping
I don't even really need to go fast
Flow back, not wandering like a nomad
So glad, yeah, they all melt like a snowman
Back-to-back flames got Drake sayin', ""Oh, man""
Not again, got a lotta friends who wanna end
All my shit, unsubscribe like I'm On Demand
I've been living in a moment, got a lot of fans
Pedophile back at it again with the white vans
Can't lie, man, I got a lot of white fans
Could I get a ultralight beam, maybe by chance?
Every day I've been switching up on my stance
Scare everyone away whenever I dance
People in the comments saying that I can't rap
Okay, 'cause I didn't understand that
Fuck you, man, I think it's time to stand back
You'll be sittin', gettin' in the way like a sandbag
If you want to talk trash, say it to my face
I'll be singin', ""La-la"", I got two LA's-
I be laughin', ""Haha"" at the human race
Hey, I'm in the lead, not far from a newer place
Uh- gettin' sick and sicker
The flow on the track gettin' quicker and quicker
Shiver me timbers, I'm winnin' these bigger
Killer victor, not swipin' left like it's Tinder
They filter my picture, put it in bad light-
Uh, me playin' these rappers is a bad fight
Ayy, me spittin' these bars, that's a mad sight
Haters be changin' their opinions, is that right?
Ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm winnin'- I'm winnin'- I'm spittin' a million words per the minute
I'm in it to win it, I'm in it to win it, I'm fixin' to hit it, uh
This shit is my mission, not up to your opinions
You know that I'm grinnin', ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 60]
But I don't wanna be a ribbon in the sky
Livin' in disguise, man, I see the venom in the middle of their eyes
Figure if you're livin' or you die
'Cause it's time for you to finish your reply
I've been dealin' with these guys, know that I ain't black and I rap
So I guess I'm automatically wack, when, matter of fact
I am better than like half of these actors
Outdated, like a battery pack that a Blackberry has
On the back of its tab
-Rapping has the wrath of attack to send a missile back to Iraq
Then leave a crack on the map
And put my train of thought right back on the track, oh
All these rappers out of breath
-That gasp like a motherfuckin' asthma attack, yeah
Match, match, match, makin' flames when I swipe right
And I ain't talkin' 'bout some crap on an app
-Blowin' up with bars like a TNT
Blowin' up: TNT, with bars: AT&T
I'm the one you may see on a screen
I won't be passin' out like, ""Hey! Is he on lean?""
Nah, I ain't about that
The music that I make is a motherfuckin' soundtrack
To the dopest life, Big Sean better bounce back
Everybody tryna raise the stakes? Well, they better take it out back
I got a lot on my mind, I cannot go behind
Uh, ayy, ayy, ayy
I just deleted the- all those lyrics
But that don't matter, 'cause I'm sayin' them in spirit, bitch, uh!

[Verse 61]
Who would'a, who would'a thought
That Quadeca woulda moved to the top? I've been doin' a lot, ayy
See me for the music I make
Not the views, not the shoes that I bought
I mean who would'a thought that I'd go up, up and away?
5K to 100K in a month how I play
'Fucker think he runnin' the game
See these haters, now they runnin' away 'cause I've come here to stay
Comin' from the jump in L.A.â
But a boy been comin' up in the Bay, where they utter my name
Man, I'm like, ""What-what do I say
To a friend who think we one in the same?"" 'Cause I'm done with the games
Sayin' ""This is fuckin' insane""
Wanted bars, well, no one can complain, yeah, they lovin' the claims
I got an abundance of pain
When I drop it, it just bust into flames, it just bust into-
Yeah

[Hook 18]
Who would'a, who would'a thought
That a motherfucker'd hop on UK vibe like I'm Drake?
Ayy, who would'a thought
I'd be spittin' all these syllables without makin' a single mistake?

[Verse 62]
But, I've actually- I've actually made a lot of mistakes, ooh, ooh
I've made a- made a lot of mistakes, ooh
I'm so big, I make hippopotamus shake, ooh
That's-that's really bad, ayy

[Interlude 20]
Uh
Got to drink some water, it's great
Got a lot on my plate... uh
Damn

[Verse 63]
This is the third time we're on this beat
I do this beat like twenty times
But that's okay, 'cause you know I got so many rhymes
You know what? On this one, I'ma just freestyle, uh
Uh, I got all your bitches on my speed dial
Ayy, and you sittin' there, meanwhile
I'm doing all this shit, I got it like it's a free trial
Free trial, I ain't spending no money
Now everybody lookin' at me, say I'm so funny
But not in a way where they're laughin' with me
Now they're laughin' at me, man, they so silly
They so- they like BILLY by Tekashi
Now everybody, you know that they wanna stop me
But they not gon' stop me 'cause I'm not gon' let them
And now, everybody, you know that I want to get up
Into the best place, into the best place
Now everybody, I be writin' all my essays
I write my music like a motherfuckin' essay
'Cause who else is doin' hu- a hundred-sixty pages on a damn song?
Uh, 'cause I'm makin' this so damn long
People lookin' at me, need a blood- motherfuckin' tampon
Yeah, 'cause he's so borin' now
Everybody, man, you know I'm makin' goals, I'm scorin' now
I'm pourin' now, all your shit is trash, I'm pourin' out
Pourin' it in-into the garbage 'cause you know I'm snorin' now
You guys are tirin', see, you are so tirin'

Ayy, I got the strings like a violin
People lookin' at me, they like how the fuck I'm rhymin' this

I got people lookin' at me now, they wanna be me, they wanna be this
But they can't, they gon' get this
Lookin' at you, I'ma shoot my shots, you better get hit
Ayy, 'cause you know I'm 'bout to get lit
Everybody, you know that I'm doin' this the best-est
The best-est in the nation
Everybody, [?] take me to the station
Best in the nation, might go on a vacation
Look at all these people: ""Uh-uh-uh-uh...""; hesitation
And I'm elevatin', got a reservate in
Ayy, all you motherfuckers waitin', but I am demonstratin'
Demonstratin' what I gotta do now
Ooh, you know that I'm movin' right through now
People lookin' at me, I'm like ""Who? How?""
I don't know, I'm just askin' a bunch of questions now
Uh, but I'm never gonna let it down
Never gonna set it down, I am like the best in town
Ayy, ayy, this is freestyled
Uh, I'm not gon' rap some more freestyle
I do it off the top of the dome, uh
Tell you all the styles that you wantin' to know
I'm might talk in gibberish, you know that I'm ridiculous
These people givin' presence like my name is Saint Nicholas
Ooh, ooh, and I'm licorice
I'm sweet, I got people, but you I'm gonna figure this out
Better figure this, put in a top, now
Ooh, but you know I'm never gonna stop now
Uh, uh, this is Hamlet
Damn, you'd be lookin' like a damn pig
You be lookin' like a damn ""Oink, oink"", bitch
I got all these people, man, you know you so annoyin'
No annoyin', I don't really even know now

[Verse 63]
Uh, you know that I'm never gonna slow down
They know me now, but don't know my sound, it is so profound
But give me two years and I'll make it, let me show you how

[Verse 64]
I got the sunglasses, put it on my sun tan
Uh, you know that I'm doing this how I can
Uh, you know I'm gonna get a sunburn
I done seen a lot of shit I wish I could unlearn
Uh, yeah, I wish that I could unsee
Uh, Playboy, Playboy bunny
Uh, dropping this, I make a lot of money
All these haters laughing, 'cause they think that shit is funny
But it ain't, but it ain't, 'cause I'm serious
When I'm doing shit, I'm getting drunk, I get delirious
Uh but you know I do it sober
I got all this water, got a four-leaf clover
Little bitch, 'cause I'm lucky, I got a lot of good luck
Uh, I said, ""Bye, have a good f-""
I don't know, I don't know
Now I gotta eat some good lunch
Lunch- I be sittin' in a lunch line
All these bitches like me, now they stealing all my punchlines
Ayy, and you know I make some rhymes
And you know I do this shit, got a drumline
Drumline, like I'm doing this on a TV show
Now you see me, I'm like C-3PO
Uh, 'cause I'm livin' in my star wars
People lookin' at me, but you know I gotta- start more
Start more when I'm playin' on a pitch
People lookin' at me now, they see me, I'm on Twitch
But I ain't on Twitch, I only streamed like one- or twice
People lookin' at me, now I'm not so nice
I'm not so nice, but you know that I eat lots of rice
And I burn that Rice too when I make a diss track
This diss, this that, making diss tracks
Uh, now you better make some Big Macs
Ooh, now I- don't have a six-pack
'Cause, I'm kind of lanky, but whatever, fuck that
Fuck that, I don't really even care now
Ooh, now you better get your hair out
Grow my hair out, grow a beard out
People lookin' at me, they know I'm makin' parodies like Weird Al
Uh, but you know I got a weird owl
Like I am- who's the guy with the owl?
Fuck! What's his name? In Harry Potter, though
Just tell me what I want to know
Hagrid! They call me Hagrid
I got Hamlet, now you know that you a bad bitch
When I walk in here as soon as I establish
People know I'm makin' this appear, like it's magic
Ayy, your life story is so tragic
Uh, better keep your mixtape in the attic
Uh, I calculate this shit like mathematics
Uh, now you know that that's past it
I'm past it, I'm past it, I'm movin' to the future
Uh, and I'm doin' what I'm used to
I'm used to this like Future and Drake
Uh, uh, now, who's-who am I gonna thank?
Who am I thankin', like at Thanksgiving
Uh, uh, you know I am great and I keep givin'
Keep givin', keep givin' on a track now
Track now, never back down
Doin' this till I passed out, till I black out
I got people looking at me, I take the trash out
Everybody, man, you know I'm makin' that sound
Make a loud sound, make a loud sound goin' downtown
Ooh, all my music is surround sound
You hear it everywhere you go, spin around now
People lookin' at me, now they never want to drown now
All your music gets drowned out in a conversation
I got these people see a star, I'm in the constellation
And you know I compile it in a compilation
Everybody, man, you know that I be livin', ah-ma-raisin
Uh, ah, uh, I don't- didn't even say a real word there
Didn't say a real word
You a real nerd, I'll be flying like a real bird
Got these bitches lookin' at me, how'd that feel? Word up!
Uh, word up, it's just like fucking nineties
People looking at me, but they never gonna find me
Like Tekashi, you better come test my gangster
People lookin' at me, but never gonna thank ya
Actually, don't test my gangster, 'cause I don't claim to be one
People lookin' at me, and I'm great, and they see ones
See fun, see ma- I just see more
Uh, yeah, your name is Seymour
Your dad's name is Seymour
I was doin' this shit, like way before
I was on tour, because I just had to take a detour
Uh, and you know that I des-
Destroy, destroy
Who are you? But I'm me, boy, but I'm- uh, me-me, boy
I don't do this shit, I just do this shit
All these rappers, man, you know that I am ludicrous
And I'm movin' bricks to the top of the charts
People lookin' at me, and you know that I'm not gonna start
I'm always gonna do it, 'cause I'm never gonna stop
People lookin' at me, now I'm sendin' all these shots
To the top of your dome, hit you, whip 'em in the dome now
Uh, and your bars, they get thrown out
And you know that I be doing this, I'm goin' down
Uh, but I'm goin' up, you goin' down!
I had to re- had to- had to do a re-phrase
You know how I had a great day
Uh, I might pull up wit' an AK
Uh, and you know I'm gonna make a great plate
Great plate, great escape, I lost my style
I lost my style.. okay
That was a- actually a pretty good freestyle, damn
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 65]
-Money on the run, that's running business
-Do this shit for fun? That's some decision
Coming in this, I wondered, ""Is this a road that they'll be fucking with?""
They loving it, making paper, like Dunder Mifflin
Still got haters and doubters I keep on running into
-Got a problem? Hop on the track, I'd love to diss you
People hate on successes, you got some fucking issues
Like- damn, need me to get you another tissue?
Just please don't go- come back, no one'll miss you
Well, I won't, I'll shrug my shoulders and just continue
On my mission, encountered a lot of villains
I'm kicking them down repeatedly lyrically, like it's some Jujitsu

[Verse 66]
Uh, damn
You know that I am the fucking man
Uh, I'ma make this money, make a hundred grand
I don't really think that you'll understand
Understand, 'cause I'm back again
A fan again, I'm going to war, like Afghanistan
What's the plan?
The plan- the plan, man, to plan man?
I'ma do the shit, I'ma do the same thing
I'ma do this shit goin' on my campaign
Celebratin' every day, I'm drinkin' champagne
Ooh, and you're gonna know my damn name
Gonna know my last name, now they see me in the rap game
Uh, they look at me like, ""How that changed""
But- t-truly nothing even changed, though
Uh, all these rappers got the same flow
So it's good to evolve, like Play-Doh
'Cause I get molded, I get molded every day, bro
Every day, bro, but I ain't Jake Paul
Sliding into home base with your bitch; baseball
Hey! And now, you're gonna go fall
Uh, but you know I'm gonna go far
I might go in Mario Kart in a go-kart
I got people, now you know I'm goin' so far
So far, but I'm never gonna backtrack
I got all these people send me pics on the Snapchat
But I don't even use Snapchat
People lookin' at me, I might move that back
To the past rap, I be doin' mad facts
All my math facts in my math class, I got backpacks
On my back-back, bag-bag it up
I got all this money, now I stack-stack it up
Oh, ayy, freestylin's pretty fun, though
To be honest, you be lookin' like a dumbo
Oh, oh, who's the winner, bitch?
You already know who won, bro!
That's-that's a horrible bar, bitch
Bar, bitch in my car, bitch
I just do this shit, I'll do this shit like an Arby's, Ar- bitch
I don't know, I just do this shit, uh
And you know that I am too legit, uh

[Verse 67]
Well, who has ever flown like this?
The only kid who's so legit and going in
They focusing, they noticing, they know it's him
Got doors I be opening
Uh- game like some Yeezy's, I've just broken in
They all convinced that I ain't supposed to win
Now my flow's like water, 'cause it's soaking in
They won't go swim, more salty than a ocean is
I'm floatin' in-

[Verse 68]
Seen as automatically wack, uh
Like an asthma attack, havin' ass in the back of your class
But you know that I don't give a motherfuckin' half of a crap
Matter of fact
I ain't never gon' be packin' my bags, and that's a wrap

[Verse 69]
People lookin' at me, now they likin' how I rap, uh
Rap, rap, rap, rap, rap song
People looking at me, know my rap is that long
It's too long, too long, might make a few songs, uh
I be gettin' bread like a crou-crouton
Cuttin' out my paper like a coupon
Uh, might rate it like Groupon
Get your group on, jget your raps on
People looking at me, now I make a rap song
Uh, uh, when I'm with your girl, I last long
That's a fact, bitch, better put it up and fact
That's a fact, better put it up in stone writin'
People lookin' at me, they be like ""I don't like it""
Well, that's too bad, I might have to go bike you
Off to the ship because, to be honest, man, I don't like you
Don't like you and that is the true shit
Uh, now you lookin' like a U, bitch
Rubik's Cube, but I ain't Logic
Uh, uh, don't do this shit for the profits
Let's be honest, I gon' make a promise
Uh, now you know that I be on this
Old advertisement, phone service, Vonage
Bon voyage, bitch, I'm on this
Uh, uh, got a Hamlet
Shakespeare, but you know you're glad that I came here
Uh, and I'll be doing this, got a great ear
I'm just listenin' to this shit, you know that it's so clear
So clear 'cause you know all of y'all not here
Uh, damn
Gotta take a sh- take a sip of this fuckin' water
*takes a sip of water*
Uh, let's read this fuckin' book
I'm just goin' in this shit, have a fuckin' look
Uh, uh, Rosencrantz
Yeah, you know I do my dance
Do my dance, got the newest shit, got the newest pants, newest plans
Everybod,y you know who I am, who I am
And that's a fact, uh
Turn on in my vid and then react, ooh
Turn on my vid, then react
""Oh my God, he's so lit!"" That's a fact
Now, they see me on the map, ooh, ooh
See me on my stats, almanac, ooh, ooh
Now they want to get it back
But they never get it back, see me, I'm settin' you back
Like eighty-five years, that's a fact
I don't know why I said that
But let's get back to the main shit, uh
Now, they see me on the playlist
Main, now I'm makin' hits, they sayin' that I'm dangerous
Now, they be comin' when I'm playin' this
Playin' this in a- in a car, though
Now, you're lookin' like a weirdo
Now you know that, I'm here, though
Uh, I ain't drinkin' no beer, though
I'm growing out my beard, so
Long, but you can't even see it
Me, now you wouldn't want to be it
I don't make fuckin'- fuckin' remix
I don't, I may use another beat, but I make it my own
Now, everybody, I am takin' my throne, stayin' alone
Now you know that I just stay in my zone
I got all these people, now you know I'm makin' it home
I'm makin' it back home, I'm makin' it back home
Now, everybody, you look like a fat gnome
Killer Keemstar, Killer Keemstar
Now you know I got three stars, I play guitar
Play keytar on my keyboard, ayy
Now you know I better get a reward
Uh, you ain't never seen me before
On the track, but I had to take a detour
Uh, now we're waitin' for the breakdown
People lookin' at me, but I'm never gonna shake now
You ju- tryna get all of my vids down and take down
Uh, fuck you and your plate now
Uh, I'm makin' plays now
I make a great sound
Make a lot of pounds
Make a lot of pounds
Make-ma-ma-ma-
Make a-make a-make a-make a lot of pounds
Your career is done, it found it in the lost and found
Damn, that could have been sick if I'd delivered it
People lookin' at me, now they really want to figure this
I'm makin' millions, but I am not a Brazilian
You know I'm skillin' it, everybody know I'm killin', that I'm killin' shit
I'm killin' shit, but I am a murderer
I ain't a murderer, I ain't a murder, see
I murder shit, do this shit to, like, the third degree
And now people lookin' at me, they ain't heard of me
But to be honest, man, I even heard of you
Uh, people lookin' at me, I ain't gon' murder you
Uh, the only thing I murder is this beat
People lookin' at me, now they turn it on and see
Now they turn it on and hear it, now they know I got the spirits
And they listen to my shit, now they likin' all my lyrics, oh
Ayy, now I'm readin' all this Shakespeare
Ayy, aren't you glad that I came here?
Ayy, how to do thirty-thousand words on it
Ayy, now you know that you're the worst on it
When you get up on a track, all your shit is fuckin' trash

Uh, now you know that I am colorful
Colorful, I got blue hundreds, I got blue hundreds
Look at me when they say ""Who runs it?""
""Who runs it?"" 'Cause that's me, bitch
Now I'm rappin' on this beat, but you know this ain't no remix
This ain't no remix, I do this shit for free, bitch
Now I'm spazzin' on the mic
I be spazzin' on the mic, literally
Now you know I'm so holy, I'm so biblically
I do this biblically, I am the literal me
People, they lookin' to do this shit figuratively
But I do it for real, I do it for real
People lookin' at me, now they're always tryna think how I feel
But I don't feel shit, I don't feel shit
Motherfucker, you know this some real shit
Hey, hey, uh, you know I got the formula
Uh, and you know that I'm just warmin' up
I could do this shit for eight more hours
People lookin' at me, you need to take more showers
'Cause you dirty, dirty, better get them hours back
Uh, now you better need a shower cap
Or this rain gon' hit you in the head, though
Uh, better put on some new headphones
I just realized I'm talkin' really loudly
These headphones were turnin' really fuckin' loud, see
Uh, but you know they so proud of me
Every single day, I got these haters, they be doubtin' me
But now, they happy to see me 'cause I be winnin' now
People lookin' at me, now you know that I be spinnin' 'round

Now you know that I'm doin' this shit I'm gettin' paper
Gettin' paper, now I'm get 'em haters

Throwin' up, now I'm gettin' older
World's tough, man, it's gettin' colder
Yeah, it's like a boulder
Like a huge rock, uh, ayy, hey
Like a huge rock
Not gonna say what I'd said, you probably could'a guessed it
Uh, now you know I send a message
Uh, I am so done, I ain't textin'
We gonna finish this track, finish it up
People lookin' at me, now they picturin' us
In a future with a future camera
On the track, man, I got the most stamina
Uh, uh, uh, Canal, Panama
I am true, though, bitch, I'm from Canada
Ayy, ayy, now I'm standin' up
I get my bands, get my bands, now my bands are up, uh
Like SOB x RBE
Uh, Bodak Yellow, call me Cardi B
Uh, I'm done now
30K words, now we're done now
Holy shit, that was 30K
Damn, that was a wordy day
That was a wordy time if you listened to the whole song
I love you long time, for so long
Seriously, if you actually did that
I'ma send you a Kit Kat

[Outro]
I'ma send you a Kit Kat to your home
So you can eat it
And then enjoy it, 'cause it's a Kit Kat and Kit Kats
Are candy
Alright, this is the most mentally-exhausting
Mentally-draining thing I've ever done
But it was pretty fun, it was pretty fun
I'm still rhymin' when I'm not even tryin' to
They say, ""How you, uh, rhyme when you ain't tryin' to?""
I don't know
That's just what I'd like to do
That's just what I like to do, you know?
I'm just gonna end this shit now, so, uh
If you enjoyed it, drop a like and subscribe
Uh, you know that is what I try to advise
Put it in vision to your vision, get a knife to your eye
Put an incision to your vision, get a knife to your eye
Oh, the beat just ended conveniently!
Great, the beat just ended conveniently, hahaha
I'm s- not strict, I do my lyrics leniently
So, I guess I'll be seein' you, and you'll be seein' me
Leave a like and subscribe to me

Ha, okay, alright, that's it
Bye! Go cop my merch too, cop my merch
It's like- it's- I- I would appreciate it

And she got moves like bad gyal RiRi

You last ten seconds, man, you're a Snapchat
Hit it in a car, hit it in a house
Hit it in a bath, hit it on a couch

I've been looking at the night
And I've been wondering what it's like
To take you somewhere that's nice
Where we can get away for a little while
I've been looking at the night
I'm a little buzzed from the wine
I'm a little drunk from the vibe
You're a little turned on from the rhythm I'm feeling inside
I've been looking at the night
And I've been wondering what it's like
To take you somewhere that's nice
Where we can get away for a little while

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't wanna go home
I just wanna stay here with you all night
I just wanna go somewhere that's right
And I just wanna spend five more hours with you
I don't wanna go home
I just wanna stay here with you all night
I just wanna go somewhere that's right
And I just wanna spend five more hours with you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
And I know it's getting late
But I don't wanna go home
And I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
And I know you gotta leave

It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know I'm in a hotel with you
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

And the paraphrased version:
You're the only one who can make me feel this way

The paraphrased version should convey the same meaning as the original line of lyrics, but in a different way.

Here are some examples of how you could paraphrase the original line:
You're the only one who can make me feel this way
You're the only one who can make me feel this way

You can also try rephrasing the original line in a different way, such as:
You're the only one who can make me feel this way
You're the only one who can make me feel this way

It's important to note that the paraphrased version should not be a direct copy of the original line, as this would not be an effective paraphrase. Instead, try to find a different way to express the same idea.

If you're still struggling to come up with a paraphrase, try looking for other versions of the song online or consulting a music encyclopedia for inspiration. You can also try listening to the song multiple times and paying attention to the lyrics to get a better sense of what the original line is trying to convey.

Once you have a good idea of what the original line is trying to say, try rephrasing it in your own words. You can use synonyms, reorder the words, or add additional details to make the paraphrase more interesting and engaging.

Remember, the goal of paraphrasing is to convey the same meaning as the original text, but in a different way. By rephrasing the original line of lyrics, you can help your audience better understand and appreciate the song.

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar

Screaming, crying, perfect storms

But you'll come back each time you leave

I have this thing where I get
emotionally attached to people and then
they die
I haven't seen the movie ""Inception""
but I've seen the commercials on television
And I've thought ever since then
That a really long time ago
We lived in a big old house in a tree
And you brought your girls up in my arms
And I used to pull your tail and hit your wings
But you knew that I'd come running to see you sometime

So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, if the high was worth the pain

And you love the game
Baby, only slept with one guy
And he's married, so it's cool

But you'll come back each summer

I've had more than my share
I'm tired of giving my love
And getting nowhere, nowhere

It's been so long since
I've touched your wanting hand
I'll put my love on the line
Yes I hope you'll understand

So, baby if you want me
You've got to show me love
Words are so easy to say, but
You've got to show me love
But, you've got to show me love

I'm tired of getting caught up
In those one night affairs
What I need is somebody who will always be there

Don't you promise me the world
World that I already
This time, call me baby
Actions speak louder than words

If you're looking for devotion
Talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
Come, my love is guaranteed

Captured effortlessly
That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was you
Holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh-whoa-oh-oh

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

He could be your lawyer on a witness stand but
He'll never love you like I can, can
He could be a stranger, given the circumstance
He could be a trophy, of a one night stand
He could have your humour, I don't understand but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

Mine is the heart, the soul for your soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can
A chance encounter of circumstance
Baby he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be a silence in this mayhem, but then again
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
Why are you looking down only one road

Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated
For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in

[Chorus]
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hopin'
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love
Waiting for love to come around

[Instrumental Break]

We are one of a kind, irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical?
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated

I'm drowning in the sea
You rescue me, want you to be here
But you're not near
I'm falling into you
And you tell me to relax
'Cause you know it's gonna be alright
But I'm hurting

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel crazy
But I know I love you
I feel like I'm in a dream
But I know I'm wide awake

[Chorus]
I want you to touch me
One more time, one more touch
I'll tell you what you want to hear
'Cause you're not really here
I'll cross the line
I'll do it every time
It's all just a game of who can love who more
No one can touch you quite like me

You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone

Call me on my cell phone

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone

And I'm standin' by the bar
And I can't see straight
I'm a little drunk
From the drink I just mixed
With the drugs that you gave me
And I'm reachin' for you
But I'll do what you tell me
I'll get you what you need

I came here with a broken heart that no one else could see
I drew a smile on my face to paper over me
But wounds heal when tears dry and cracks they don't show
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go back to simplicity
I feel like I've been missing me
Was not who I'm supposed to be
I felt this darkness over me
We all get there eventually
I never knew where I belonged
But I was right and you were wrong
Been telling myself all along

[Chorus]
Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

Let's go back to simplicity
I feel like I've been missing me

Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, I
I learned to wave goodbye
How not to see my life
Through someone else's eyes
It's not an easy road
But now I'm not alone
So I, I won't be so hard on myself no more

[Chorus]
Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own

Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone

Marvin Gaye Lyrics[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
I've been thinking 'bout a new direction
And I'm like, ""What's up, baby? I'm on my way over""
Just tell me where you want it
I'll be there by the morning
And you'll be in my arms again

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I'm going through changes
It's a new day
And I'm feeling great
I'm looking forward to the future

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Got my hands up
They are praying
For the man inside me
Oh, Marvin Gaye
It's my birthday
I'm invited
To the party
Oh, Marvin Gaye
Oh, Marvin Gaye

I've been spinnin' now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sippin' on red wine
I've been sittin' here for ages
Rippin' out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?

Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

Fading out again

I was never meant to hurt no one
And I saw scars upon a broken-hearted lover

And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons

Two more years and you'll be fine
I'm still your mirror, clean
'Cause I can take the dark out of the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Time won't leave me as I am
So I will not leave me as I was

I'm still breathing, just barely
Two more years and you'll be fine
I'm still your mirror, clean
'Cause I can take the dark out of the night

(Hey) Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
(Hey) Hey, went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
""Son, don't let it slip away""
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)
""When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid""

[Chorus]
He said, ""One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember""
My father told me when I was just a child
""These are the nights that never die""

The Nights Lyrics[Verse 1]
I woke up, I was dreaming
I was dreaming of my sweetheart
She's waiting for me in a place
Where they have no time for us
Oh, I'll be with you, I'll be with you
Oh, I'll be with you, I'll be with you

[Chorus]
'Cause these nights are so long
'Cause these nights are so long
'Cause these nights are so long
'Cause these nights are so long

I woke up, I was dreaming
I was dreaming of my sweetheart
I'm still dreaming of her face
Even though she's gone, she's gone

Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

[Verse 2]
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Wait for me to come home

Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, well, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on 6th Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home""275Embed","""We created this love
Just to watch it burn""

I think that it's interesting how Ed Sheeran uses the word ""we"" instead of ""I"" in the line of lyrics, because it shows that he was involved in creating the love that he had with the girl in the song, and he also had the idea to watch it burn.

Ed Sheeran's song ""Photograph"" is a great example of how he uses metaphors and other literary devices to make his songs more interesting and meaningful.

In this song, Ed Sheeran uses the metaphor of a photograph to describe his memories of a past relationship. He talks about how the photograph captures the moments they shared together and how it brings back memories of their love.

Ed Sheeran also uses other literary devices such as personification and alliteration to make the song more interesting. For example, he talks about how the photograph is ""holding a memory I haven't thought of in years"" and how it is ""a window to a different time"". He also uses alliteration to create a rhythm and flow to the song.

Overall, Ed Sheeran's song ""Photograph"" is a great example of how he uses metaphors and other literary devices to make his songs more interesting and meaningful. It is a beautiful song that captures the feeling of nostalgia and love, and it is sure to be a hit with fans.

Photograph

[Verse 1]
It was late in the night
When we were both kind of broken
When our lips met, oh, it was just like starting something new

[Chorus]
And I know you've been hurting, but I've been hurting too
And I'm not home again, but neither are you
So why can't we just be friends?
And I promise I will never do you wrong
And I promise I'll never sing of the heartbreaks we've seen
We'll just remain in love, but we'll try to forget
Everything else

[Verse 2]
And you throw your head back, laughing like a little kid
I remember how we'd rush back home, and start to make it alright
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love, not knowing what it was
I will still feel you in my hips, the curve of your smile, my god

[Chorus]
And I know you've been hurting, but I've been hurting too
And I'm not home again, but neither are you
So why can't we just be friends?
And I promise I will never do you wrong
And I promise I'll never sing of the heartbreaks we've seen

Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know

I'm at a crossroads, no turning back
I need a one-way ticket to the place where you are
I'm going somewhere I've never been before
I'm leaving my fate up to the hands of the gods

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
You said, ""I'm just trying to make a living""
And the game gon' test you, that's why I call you
'Cause I'm tryna make it, yeah, I call you, baby
When you're down and troubled and you need a helping hand
And I'll come to ease your mind, I'll solve your problem
We'll do it every time, yeah, I'm on one

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
I'm just calling out your name
But you're not around, I'm leaving a message at the beep
So if you're listening to this song
Just pick up the phone, pick up the phone

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Yeah, I know she's been talking shit
But I don't know who's been feeding you with this
You're a fucking idiot, don't be fucking stupid
'Cause I'll be damned if some other nigga's touching you
You should be ashamed of yourself
You got a text from your ex saying he's got pictures of you
And I'm not the one to test, I'm not the one to joke with
You're not the one I'm fucking with, you're far from being equal

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself

Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

And I gotta tell you right now, that it's too late to say you miss me

Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me

This woman is my destiny
She said, ooh-ooh, shut up and dance with me

The chemical, physical kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together

Shut Up and Dance Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I'm talking to my buddy and he's telling me
He just met this girl, and then we talk for hours
And then you call and say, ""Come over, man, you've got to be ignored""
But I'll be waiting here for you

[Pre-Chorus]
She told me her name was Ginger
I said, ""Oh, my god, yeah, right, yeah, yeah, yeah""
She told me I could call her Virginia, but I said, ""No way, man, no way""
Just shut up and dance with me

We're both getting kinda hot tonight
So just shut up and dance with me
We're both getting kinda hot tonight
So just shut up and dance with me
We're both getting kinda hot tonight
So just shut up and dance with me
We're both getting kinda hot tonight
So just shut up and dance with me

I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
[Verse 2: Kanye West & Paul McCartney]
Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
We can run
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
I'm on a mystery
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz

[Chorus: Rihanna & Kanye West]
Yeah, I'm 'bout four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday

But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand, yeah

Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness (Mhm)
