'Cause I could be at yours on Friday
Tonight's at the place we started
It's a long way back from ""sorry"", but here I go
How does it feel? How does it feel? (Just tell me somethin')

[Verse 1]
I don't know what to tell you, I don't know what to say
I got into my head, I'm sorry I threw it away
But I'm so glad you came back even through all the pain
Let me try and mend it, I can promise, I swear that I've changed

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, let me give you all of me
Can we just sort it out for real?

It's a long way back from ""sorry"", but here I go

It was raining, I was out on the porch
You were there, you were soaking wet
I was wearing my favourite dress, you didn't notice
That was the night I knew you were the one

[Pre-Chorus: Em Beihold]
I got a little bit of a crush on you
It's been a while since I've been around anyone
I guess I got a little bit of a fantasy

I'm starvin', darlin'
Let me put my lips to something
Let me wrap my teeth around the world
Start carvin', darlin'
I wanna smell the dinner cookin'
I wanna feel the edges start to burn

[Pre-Chorus]
Honey, I wanna race you to the table
If you hesitate, the gettin' is gone
I won't lie if there's somethin' to be gained
There's money to be made, whatever's still to come

[Chorus]
Get some
Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung
Seven new ways that you can eat your young
Come and get some
Skinnin' the children for a war drum
Puttin' food on the table sellin' bombs and guns
It's quicker and easier to eat your young

I wanna be your friend, go shoppin' in the Benz

I'll hit you when I land, can you fit me in your plans?
I like you, I do
We went over to France, then we woke up in Japan
I like you, I do (I do)
Oh girl, I know you only like it fancy
So I pull up in that Maybach Candy
Yeah, your boyfriend'll never understand me
'Cause I'm 'bout to pull his girl like a hammy, hammy
Let's take a lil' dip, lil' lady
Hit PCH, 180
Yeah, I've been thinkin' lately
That I need someone to save me
Now that I'm famous, I got hoes all around me, but
I need a good girl, I need someone to ground me, so
Please be true, don't fuck around with me
I need someone to share this heart with me
Fill you up, then run it back again
Oh girl I like you, I do
I wanna be your friend, go shoppin' in the Benz

And I coulda copped a Birkin but I cop Celine
Why we got the same taste for the finer things?

Now he got me on a leash 'cause he said no strings
You know I'm cool with that
Stole the pussy, you ain't get sued for that
Wonder what a nigga might do for that (do, might do)
I could be your Chaka, where Rufus at? (Where?)

I just got a feeling that we might be friends for a long, long time
You don't mind, and you know I like you for that

All it takes is a downtown bar
All it takes is some neon stars

Walk away, then, we hit rewind

Don't know what keeps keepin' it up

Is it your heart or mine?
Is it whiskey or wine?
Is it somethin' in the night
Makin' us wanna cross that line?

Love ain't too far behind
It's just a matter of time
'Til it finds your heart or mine

We say that it ain't no thing
We say it, then, the telephone rings
A hello, ar–µ you at home

When you think of all the late nights
Lame fights over the phone
Wake up in the‚ÄÖmornin'‚ÄÖwith someone
But feelin'‚ÄÖalone

[Refrain]
A heart is drawn around your‚ÄÖname
In someone's handwriting, not mine
Sneakin' out into town
Holdin' hands, just‚Åükillin'‚Åütime

[Pre-Chorus]
Your‚Åüpast and mine‚Åüare parallel lines
Stars‚Åüall aligned and they intertwined
And taught you
The way you call me ""baby""
Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is

[Chorus]
All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town (Ooh)
Cryin' in the bathroom for some dude
Whose name I cannot remember now

[Refrain]
Secret jokes all alone
No one's home, sixteen and wild (Ooh)
Breakin' up, makin' up
Leave without sayin' goodbye (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And just know that
It's everything that made me
Now I call you ""baby""
It's why you're so amazing

[Chorus]
All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more
[Bridge]
Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you there's good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here
I wanna teach you how forever feels like

[Chorus]
The girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street (Dead-end street) led you straight to me (Straight to me)
Now you're all I need (All I need), I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

I hate you met the sinner
Lord knows I ain't no saint

You put up with more than I ever would've
And you left just like you should've
But since you've been gone
Ain't nothing 'round here the same

'Cause girl, I've given up on
Drinking as much as I used to when I had you
Given up on, just sayin' I'm gonna change
I've given up on passing the blame
Everything made you walk out on what we had
But when it comes to wanting you back
I ain't ever giving up on that

We've been burnin' both ends
Keepin' the lights on
So I've been thinkin' we need
A little time alone

[Pre-Chorus]
So what you say we cancel our plans?
Tonight I'm only gonna be your man

[Chorus]
Let's get some candles burning
And some records turning
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's moving
Keep doing what you're doing to me all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Makin' the kind of love we make

[Verse 2]
There ain't no way, baby
To get me out this house
When you look this good
What could I even think about? Oh, oh

If I'm in a barroom and she's in a Nashville party
And we see each other from across the room
I'll be there in a second, and she'll be gone in a minute
And that's just the kind of love we make

[Chorus]
We don't waste time on goodbyes
We don't go to bed and cry
We're not the kind to sit around and wonder why
We're just the kind to make it work
If you want to know what love's about
If you want to know what it's really like
Well, that's the kind of love we make

I'm the type of person who gets depressed easily
And I don't like being the center of attention
Sometimes I wish I was someone else
Someone who's more outgoing than me
I've always wanted to change
I've always wanted to be more popular

[Pre-Chorus: Cupid]
I've been wanting to be someone else
Since I was a kid
I've been wanting to be someone else
Since I was a kid

[Chorus: Cupid]
If I had a chance to go back in time
I would change the way that I am
I would change the way that I am
I would change the way that I am
If I had a chance to go back in time
I would change the way that I am
I would change the way that I am
I would change the way that I am

[Verse 2: Cupid]
I'm the type of person who is good at everything
And I'm a good listener
I can always say the right thing
And I'm not the kind of person who gets jealous
Sometimes I wish I was someone else
Someone who's more cool than me
I've always wanted to change
I've always wanted to be cooler than me

ContributorsWhen Love Sucks (feat. Dido) Lyrics[Chorus]
When love sucks, I just pop the champagne
When love sucks, I just pop the champagne
When love sucks, I just pop the champagne
When love sucks, I just pop the champagne

[Verse 1]
You told me that I was the only one
That you could ever truly love
But you found someone else who's better than me
And that's the only reason you left

[Chorus]
When love sucks, I just pop the champagne
When love sucks, I just pop the champagne
When love sucks, I just pop the champagne
When love sucks, I just pop the champagne

[Verse 2]
I know you don't mean to hurt me
But I'm still a little insecure
You said you'll always be there for me
And that you'll never leave my side
But you found someone better than me
And that's the only reason you left

[Intro: KAROL G]
La que te dijo que un vac√≠o se llena con otra persona te miente
E' como tapar una herida con maquillaje: no se ve, pero se siente
Te fuiste diciendo que me superaste (Ey) y te conseguiste nueva novia (Novia)
Lo que ella no sabe es que t√∫ todav√≠a (Auh) me est√°' viendo to'a' la historia' (Papi)

Dile a tu nueva beb√© que por hombre' no compito
Que deje de estar tirando, que al meno' yo te ten√≠a bonito

[Verso 1: Shakira]
Verte con la nueva me doli√≥ (Doli√≥)
Pero ya estoy puesta pa' lo m√≠o
Lo que vivimos se me olvid√≥
Y eso e' lo que te tiene ofendido
Que hasta la vida me mejor√≥
Por ac√° ya no eres bienvenido
Vi lo que tu novia me tir√≥
Eso no da ni rabia, yo me r√≠o, yo me r√≠o

[Verso 2: KAROL G & Shakira]
No tengo tiempo pa' lo que no aporte, ya cambi√© mi norte
Haciendo dinero como deporte
Llenando la cuenta, los show', el parking y el pasaporte (Ey)
'Toy m√°s dura dicen lo' reporte' (S√≠)
Ahora t√∫ quiere' volver, se te nota, mmm, s√≠
'P√©rame ah√≠, que yo soy idiota (Ah)

Well, I've been known to write a few songs
Lovin' and leavin' and gettin' too stoned
Bottle and a pistol by my side
The devil's always along for the ride

[Verse 1]
We ride down to the creek by the water
I've been baptized by the preacher's daughter
Lucky for me, no, he never caught us, oh
Oh, we ride to the bar by the levee
'85 jacked-up, square-body Chevy
Blanket in the back when it gets hot and heavy, oh
Oh, we rid–µ
Pedal to the floorboard, she b–µggin' for more
Sippin' on apple pie moonshine
And I'll be gone by the mornin' light

[Chorus]
Yeah, 'cause I've been known to write a few songs
Lovin' and leavin' and gettin' too stoned
Bottle and a pistol by my side
The devil's always along for the ride

[Verse 2]
We ride across state lines
Rubbin' two nickels just tryin' to make a dime
Hard to make a livin' while the gas is so high
Oh, we ride
Like a Harley on a two-lane, Palomino crossplane
Drop her down to four-wheel drive on a Friday night
Crackin' open a cold Bud Light
Oh, we ride
Pushin' through the hard love, lookin' for my give-a-fuck
Needle peggin' ninety-five, but that's alright
'Cause I'm runnin' every red light

410,Disco Voyager,Oliver Heldens,Disco Voyager,54,"2 ContributorsThe History of Herodotus, Vol I (Chap. 2) LyricsThe Second Book Of The Histories, Called Euterpe


1. When Cyrus had brought his life to an end, Cambyses received the royal power in succession, being the son of Cyrus and of Cassandane the daughter of Pharnaspes, for whose death, which came about before his own, Cyrus had made great mourning himself and also had proclaimed to all those over whom he bore rule that they should make mourning for her: Cambyses, I say, being the son of this woman and of Cyrus, regarded the Ionians and Aiolians as slaves inherited from his father; and he proceeded to march an army against Egypt, taking with him as helpers not only the other nations of which he was the ruler, but also those of the Hellenes over whom he had power besides.

2. Now the Egyptians, before the time when Psammetichos 1 became king over them, were wont to suppose that they had come into being first of all men; but since the time when Psammetichos having become king desired to know what men had come into being first, they suppose that the Phrygians came into being before themselves, but they themselves before all other men. Now Psammetichos, when he was not able by inquiry to find out any means of knowing who had come into being first of all men, contrived a device of the following kind:‚ÄîTaking two new-born children belonging to persons of the common sort he gave them to a shepherd to bring up at the place where his flocks were, with a manner of bringing up such as I shall say, charging him namely that no man should utter any word in their presence, and that they should be placed by themselves in a room where none might come, and at the proper time he should bring to them she-goats, and when he had satisfied them with milk he should do for them whatever else was needed. These things Psammetichos did and gave him this charge wishing to hear what word the children would let break forth first, after they had ceased from wailings without sense. And accordingly so it came to pass; for after a space of two years had gone by, during which the shepherd went on acting so, at length, when he opened the door and entered, both the children fell before him in entreaty and uttered the word bekos, stretching forth their hands. At first when he heard this the shepherd kept silence; but since this word was often repeated, as he visited them constantly and attended to them, at last he declared the matter to his master, and at his command he brought the children before his face. Then Psammetichos having himself also heard it, began to inquire about what nation of men named anything bekos, and inquiring he found that the Phrygians had this name for bread. In this manner and guided by an indication such as this, the Egyptians were brought to allow that the Phrygians were a more ancient people than themselves.

3. That so it came to pass I heard from the priests of that Hephaistos who dwells at Memphis; 2 but the Hellenes relate, besides many other idle tales, that Psammetichos cut out the tongues of certain women, and then caused the children to live with these women.

With regard then to the rearing of the children they related so much as I have said: and I heard also other things at Memphis when I had speech with the priests of Hephaistos. Moreover I visited both Thebes and Heliopolis 3 for this very cause, namely because I wished to know whether the priests at these places would agree in their accounts with those at Memphis; for the men of Heliopolis are said to be the most learned in records of the Egyptians. Those of their narrations which I heard with regard to the gods I am not earnest to relate in full, but I shall name them only, 4 because I consider that all men are equally ignorant of these matters: 5 and whatever things of them I may record, I shall record only because I am compelled by the course of the story.

4. But as to those matters which concern men, the priests agreed with one another in saying that the Egyptians were the first of all men on earth to find out the course of the year, having divided the seasons into twelve parts to make up the whole; and this they said they found out from the stars: and they reckon to this extent more wisely than the Hellenes, as it seems to me, inasmuch as the Hellenes throw in an intercalated month every other year, to make the seasons right, whereas the Egyptians, reckoning the twelve months at thirty days each, bring in also every year five days beyond the number, and thus the circle of their seasons is completed and comes round to the same point whence it set out. They said moreover that the Egyptians were the first who brought into use appellations for the twelve gods and the Hellenes took up the use from them; and that they were the first who assigned altars and images and temples to the gods, and who engraved figures on stones; and with regard to the greater number of these things they showed me by actual facts that they had happened so. They said also that the first man 6 who became king of Egypt was Min; 7 and that in his time all Egypt except the district of Thebes 8 was a swamp, and none of the regions were then above water which now lie below the lake of Moiris, to which lake it is a voyage of seven days up the river from the sea:

5, and I thought that they said well about the land; for it is manifest in truth even to a person who has not heard it beforehand but has only seen, at least if he have understanding, that the Egypt to which the Hellenes come in ships is a land which has been won by the Egyptians as an addition, and that it is a gift of the river: moreover the regions which lie above this lake also for a distance of three days' sail, about which they did not go on to say anything of this kind, are nevertheless another instance of the same thing: for the nature of the land of Egypt is as follows:‚ÄîFirst when you are still approaching it in a ship and are distant a day's run from the land, if you let down a sounding-line you will bring up mud and will find yourself in eleven fathoms. This then so far shows that there is a silting forward of the land.

6. Then secondly, as to Egypt itself, the extent of it along the sea is sixty schoines, according to our definition of Egypt as extending from the Gulf of Plinthine to the Serbonian lake, along which stretches Mount Casion; from this lake then 9 the sixty schoines are reckoned: for those of men who are poor in land have their country measured by fathoms, those who are less poor by furlongs, those who have much land by parasangs, and those who have land in very great abundance by schoines: now the parasang is equal to thirty furlongs, and each schoine, which is an Egyptian measure, is equal to sixty furlongs. So there would be an extent of three thousand six hundred furlongs for the coast-land of Egypt. 10

7. From thence and as far as Heliopolis inland Egypt is broad, and the land is all flat and without springs of water 11 and formed of mud: and the road as one goes inland from the sea to Heliopolis is about the same in length as that which leads from the altar of the twelve gods at Athens to Pisa and the temple of Olympian Zeus: reckoning up you would find the difference very small by which these roads fail of being equal in length, not more indeed than fifteen furlongs; for the road from Athens to Pisa wants fifteen furlongs of being fifteen hundred, while the road to Heliopolis from the sea reaches that number completely.

8. From Heliopolis however, as you go up, Egypt is narrow; for on the one side a mountain-range belonging to Arabia stretches along by the side of it, going in a direction from North towards the midday and the South Wind, tending upwards without a break to that which is called the Erythraian Sea, in which range are the stone-quarries which were used in cutting stone for the pyramids at Memphis. On this side then the mountain ends where I have said, and then takes a turn back; 12 and where it is widest, as I was informed, it is a journey of two months across from East to West; and the borders of it which turn towards the East are said to produce frankincense. Such then is the nature of this mountain-range; and on the side of Egypt towards Libya another range extends, rocky and enveloped in sand: in this are the pyramids, and it runs in the same direction as those parts of the Arabian mountains which go towards the midday. So then, I say, from Heliopolis the land has no longer a great extent so far as it belongs to Egypt, 13 and for about four 14 days' sail up the river Egypt properly so called is narrow: and the space between the mountain-ranges which have been mentioned is plain-land, but where it is narrowest it did not seem to me to exceed two hundred furlongs from the Arabian mountains to those which are called the Libyan. After this again Egypt is broad.

9. Such is the nature of this land: and from Heliopolis to Thebes is a voyage up the river of nine days, and the distance of the journey in furlongs is four thousand eight hundred and sixty, the number of the schoines being eighty-one. If these measures of Egypt in furlongs be put together the result is as follows:‚ÄîI have already before this shown that the distance along the sea amounts to three thousand six hundred furlongs, and I will now declare what the distance is inland from the sea to Thebes, namely six thousand one hundred and twenty furlongs: and again the distance from Thebes to the city called Elephantine is one thousand eight hundred furlongs.

10. Of this land then, concerning which I have spoken, it seemed to myself also, according as the priests said, that the greater part had been won as an addition by the Egyptians; for it was evident to me that the space between the aforesaid mountain-ranges, which lie above the city of Memphis, once was a gulf of the sea, like the regions about Ilion and Teuthrania and Ephesos and the plain of the Maiander, if it be permitted to compare small things with great; and small these are in comparison, for of the rivers which heaped up the soil in those regions none is worthy to be compared in volume with a single one of the mouths of the Nile, which has five mouths. 15 Moreover there are other rivers also, not in size at all equal to the Nile, which have performed great feats; of which I can mention the names of several, and especially the Achelo√∂s, which flowing through Acarnania and so issuing out into the sea has already made half of the Echinades from islands into mainland.

11. Now there is in the land of Arabia, not far from Egypt, a gulf of the sea running in from that which is called the Erythraian Sea, very long and narrow, as I am about to tell. With respect to the length of the voyage along it, one who set out from the innermost point to sail out through it into the open sea, would spend forty days upon the voyage, using oars; 16 and with respect to breadth, where the gulf is broadest it is half a day's sail across: and there is in it an ebb and flow of tide every day. Just such another gulf I suppose that Egypt was, and that the one ran in towards Ethiopia from the Northern Sea, and the other, the Arabian, of which I am about to speak, 17 tended from the South towards Syria, the gulfs boring in so as almost to meet at their extreme points, and passing by one another with but a small space left between. If then the stream of the Nile should turn aside into this Arabian gulf, what would hinder that gulf from being filled up with silt as the river continued to flow, at all events within a period of twenty thousand years? indeed for my part I am of opinion that it would be filled up even within ten thousand years. How, then, in 18 all the time that has elapsed before I came into being should not a gulf be filled up even of much greater size than this by a river so great and so active?

12. As regards Egypt then, I both believe those who say that things are so, and for myself also I am strongly of opinion that they are so; because I have observed that Egypt runs out into the sea further than the adjoining land, and that shells are found upon the mountains of it, and an efflorescence of salt forms upon the surface, so that even the pyramids are being eaten away by it, and moreover that of all the mountains of Egypt, the range which lies above Memphis is the only one which has sand: besides which I notice that Egypt resembles neither the land of Arabia, which borders upon it, nor Libya, nor yet Syria (for they are Syrians who dwell in the parts of Arabia lying along the sea), but that it has soil which is black and easily breaks up, 19 seeing that it is in truth mud and silt brought down from Ethiopia by the river: but the soil of Libya, we know, is reddish in colour and rather sandy, while that of Arabia and Syria is somewhat clayey and rocky. 1901

13. The priests also gave me a strong proof concerning this land as follows, namely that in the reign of king Moiris, whenever the river reached a height of at least eight cubits 20 it watered Egypt below Memphis; and not yet nine hundred years had gone by since the death of Moiris, when I heard these things from the priests: now however, unless the river rises to sixteen cubits, or fifteen at the least, it does not go over the land. I think too that those Egyptians who dwell below the lake of Moiris and especially in that region which is called the Delta, if that land continues to grow in height according to this proportion and to increase similarly in extent, 21 will suffer for all remaining time, from the Nile not overflowing their land, that same thing which they themselves said that the Hellenes would at some time suffer: for hearing that the whole land of the Hellenes has rain and is not watered by rivers as theirs is, they said that the Hellenes would at some time be disappointed of a great hope and would suffer the ills of famine. This saying means that if the god 22 shall not send them rain, but shall allow drought to prevail for a long time, the Hellenes will be destroyed by hunger; for they have in fact no other supply of water to save them except from Zeus alone.

14. This has been rightly said by the Egyptians with reference to the Hellenes: but now let me tell how matters are with the Egyptians themselves in their turn. If, in accordance with what I before said, their land below Memphis (for this is that which is increasing) shall continue to increase in height according to the same proportion as in past time, assuredly those Egyptians who dwell here will suffer famine, if their land shall not have rain nor the river be able to go over their fields. It is certain however that now they gather in fruit from the earth with less labour than any other men and also with less than the other Egyptians; for they have no labour in breaking up furrows with a plough nor in hoeing nor in any other of those labours which other men have about a crop; but when the river has come up of itself and watered their fields and after watering has left them again, then each man sows his own field and turns into it swine, and when he has trodden the seed into the ground by means of the swine, after that he waits for the harvest; and when he has threshed the corn by means of the swine, then he gathers it in.

15. If we desire to follow the opinions of the Ionians as regards Egypt, who say that the Delta alone is Egypt, reckoning its sea-coast to be from the watch-tower called of Perseus to the fish-curing houses of Pelusion, a distance of forty schoines, and counting it to extend inland as far as the city of Kercasoros, where the Nile divides and runs to Pelusion and Canobos, while as for the rest of Egypt, they assign it partly to Libya and partly to Arabia,‚Äîif, I say, we should follow this account, we should thereby declare that in former times the Egyptians had no land to live in; for, as we have seen, their Delta at any rate is alluvial, and has appeared (so to speak) lately, as the Egyptians themselves say and as my opinion is. If then at the first there was no land for them to live in, why did they waste their labour to prove that they had come into being before all other men? They needed not to have made trial of the children to see what language they would first utter. However I am not of opinion that the Egyptians came into being at the same time as that which is called by the Ionians the Delta, but that they existed always ever since the human race came into being, and that as their land advanced forwards, many of them were left in their first abodes and many came down gradually to the lower parts. At least it is certain that in old times Thebes had the name of Egypt, and of this 23 the circumference measures six thousand one hundred and twenty furlongs.

16. If then we judge aright of these matters, the opinion of the Ionians about Egypt is not sound: but if the judgment of the Ionians is right, I declare that neither the Hellenes nor the Ionians themselves know how to reckon since they say that the whole earth is made up of three divisions, Europe, Asia, and Libya: for they ought to count in addition to these the Delta of Egypt, since it belongs neither to Asia nor to Libya; for at least it cannot be the river Nile by this reckoning which divides Asia from Libya, 24 but the Nile is cleft at the point of this Delta so as to flow round it, and the result is that this land would come between Asia and Libya. 25

17. We dismiss then the opinion of the Ionians, and express a judgment of our own in this matter also, that Egypt is all that land which is inhabited by Egyptians, just as Kilikia is that which is inhabited by Kilikians and Assyria that which is inhabited by Assyrians, and we know of no boundary properly speaking between Asia and Libya except the borders of Egypt. If however we shall adopt the opinion which is commonly held by the Hellenes, we shall suppose that the whole of Egypt, beginning from the Cataract 26 and the city of Elephantine, is divided into two parts and that it thus partakes of both the names, since one side will thus belong to Libya and the other to Asia; for the Nile from the Cataract onwards flows to the sea cutting Egypt through the midst; and as far as the city of Kercasoros the Nile flows in one single stream, but from this city onwards it is parted into three ways; and one, which is called the Pelusian mouth, turns towards the East; the second of the ways goes towards the West, and this is called the Canobic mouth; but that one of the ways which is straight runs thus,‚Äîwhen the river in its course downwards comes to the point of the Delta, then it cuts the Delta through the midst and so issues out to the sea. In this we have 27 a portion of the water of the river which is not the smallest nor the least famous, and it is called the Sebennytic mouth. There are also two other mouths which part off from the Sebennytic and go to the sea, and these are called, one the Sa√Øtic, the other the Mendesian mouth. The Bolbitinitic and Bucolic mouths, on the other hand, are not natural but made by digging.

18. Moreover also the answer given by the Oracle of Ammon bears witness in support of my opinion that Egypt is of the extent which I declare it to be in my account; and of this answer I heard after I had formed my own opinion about Egypt. For those of the city of Marea and of Apis, dwelling in the parts of Egypt which border on Libya, being of opinion themselves that they were Libyans and not Egyptians, and also being burdened by the rules of religious service, because they desired not to be debarred from the use of cows' flesh, sent to Ammon saying that they had nought in common with the Egyptians, for they dwelt outside the Delta and agreed with them in nothing; and they said they desired that it might be lawful for them to eat everything without distinction. The god however did not permit them to do so, but said that that land which was Egypt which the Nile came over and watered, and that those were Egyptians who dwelling below the city of Elephantine drank of that river. Thus it was answered to them by the Oracle about this:

19, and the Nile, when it is in flood, goes over not only the Delta but also of the land which is called Libyan and of that which is called Arabian sometimes as much as two days' journey on each side, and at times even more than this or at times less.

As regards the nature of the river, neither from the priests nor yet from any other man was I able to obtain any knowledge: and I was desirous especially to learn from them about these matters, namely why the Nile comes down increasing in volume from the summer solstice onwards for a hundred days, and then, when it has reached the number of these days, turns and goes back, failing in its stream, so that through the whole winter season it continues to be low, and until the summer solstice returns. Of none of these things was I able to receive any account from the Egyptians, when I inquired of them what power the Nile has whereby it is of a nature opposite to that of other rivers. And I made inquiry, desiring to know both this which I say and also why, unlike all other rivers, it does not give rise to any breezes blowing from it.

20. However some of the Hellenes who desired to gain distinction for cleverness have given an account of this water in three different ways: two of these I do not think it worth while even to speak of except only to indicate their nature; of which the one says that the Etesian Winds are the cause that makes the river rise, by preventing the Nile from flowing out into the sea. But often the Etesian Winds fail and yet the Nile does the same work as it is wont to do; and moreover, if these were the cause, all the other rivers also which flow in a direction opposed to the Etesian Winds ought to have been affected in the same way as the Nile, and even more, in as much as they are smaller and present to them a feebler flow of stream: but there are many of these rivers in Syria and many also in Libya, and they are affected in no such manner as the Nile.

21. The second way shows more ignorance than that which has been mentioned, and it is more marvellous to tell; 28 for it says that the river produces these effects because it flows from the Ocean, and that the Ocean flows round the whole earth.

22. The third of the ways is much the most specious, but nevertheless it is the most mistaken of all: for indeed this way has no more truth in it than the rest, alleging as it does that the Nile flows from melting snow; whereas it flows out of Libya through the midst of the Ethiopians, and so comes out into Egypt. How then should it flow from snow, when it flows from the hottest parts to those which are cooler? And indeed most of the facts are such as to convince a man (one at least who is capable of reasoning about such matters), that it is not at all likely that it flows from snow. 29 The first and greatest evidence is afforded by the winds, which blow hot from these regions; the second is that the land is rainless always and without frost, whereas after snow has fallen rain must necessarily come within five days, so that if it snowed in those parts rain would fall there; the third evidence is afforded by the people dwelling there, who are of a black colour by reason of the burning heat. Moreover kites and swallows remain there through the year and do not leave the land; and cranes flying from the cold weather which comes on in the region of Scythia come regularly to these parts for wintering: if then it snowed ever so little in that land through which the Nile flows and in which it has its rise, none of these things would take place, as necessity compels us to admit.
23. As for him who talked about the Ocean, he carried his tale into the region of the unknown, and so he need not be refuted; 30 since I for my part know of no river Ocean existing, but I think that Homer or one of the poets who were before him invented the name and introduced it into his verse.

24. If however after I have found fault with the opinions proposed, I am bound to declare an opinion of my own about the matters which are in doubt, I will tell what to my mind is the reason why the Nile increases in the summer. In the winter season the Sun, being driven away from his former path through the heaven 31 by the stormy winds, comes to the upper parts of Libya. If one would set forth the matter in the shortest way, all has now been said; for whatever region this god approaches most and stands directly above, this it may reasonably be supposed is most in want of water, and its native streams of rivers are dried up most.

25. However, to set it forth at greater length, thus it is:‚Äîthe Sun passing in his course by the upper parts of Libya, does thus, that is to say, since at all times the air in those parts is clear and the country is warm, because there are no cold winds, 32 in passing through it the Sun does just as he was wont to do in the summer, when going through the midst of the heaven, that is he draws to himself the water, and having drawn it he drives it away to the upper parts of the country, and the winds take it up and scattering it abroad melt it into rain; so it is natural that the winds which blow from this region, namely the South and South-west Winds, should be much the most rainy of all the winds. I think however that the Sun does not send away from himself all the water of the Nile of each year, but that he also lets some remain behind with himself. Then when the winter becomes milder, the Sun returns back again to the midst of the heaven, and from that time onwards he draws equally from all rivers; but in the meanwhile they flow in large volume, since water of rain mingles with them in great quantity, because their country receives rain then and is filled with torrent streams. In summer however they are weak, since not only the showers of rain fail then, but also they are drawn by the Sun. The Nile however, alone of all rivers, not having rain and being drawn by the Sun, naturally flows during this time of winter in much less than its proper volume, that is much less than in summer; 33 for then it is drawn equally with all the other waters, but in winter it bears the burden alone. Thus I suppose the Sun to be the cause of these things.

26. He is also the cause in my opinion that the air in these parts is dry, since he makes it so by scorching up his path through the heaven: 34 thus summer prevails always in the upper parts of Libya. If however the station of the seasons had been changed, and where now in the heaven are placed the North Wind and winter, there was the station of the South Wind and of the midday, and where now is placed the South Wind, there was the North, if this had been so, the Sun being driven from the midst of the heaven by the winter and the North Wind would go to the upper parts of Europe, just as now he comes to the upper parts of Libya, and passing in his course throughout the whole of Europe I suppose that he would do to the Ister that which he now works upon the Nile.

27. As to the breeze, why none blows from the river, my opinion is that from very hot places it is not natural that anything should blow, and that a breeze is wont to blow from something cold.

28. Let these matters then be as they are and as they were at the first: but as to the sources of the Nile, not one either of the Egyptians or of the Libyans or of the Hellenes, who came to speech with me, professed to know anything, except the scribe of the sacred treasury of Athene at the city of Sa√Øs in Egypt. To me however this man seemed not to be speaking seriously when he said that he had certain knowledge of it; and he said as follows, namely that there were two mountains of which the tops ran up to a sharp point, situated between the city of Syene, which is in the district of Thebes, and Elephantine, and the names of the mountains were, of the one Crophi and of the other Mophi. From the middle between these two mountains flowed (he said) the sources of the Nile, which were fathomless in depth, and half of the water flowed to Egypt and towards the North Wind, the other half to Ethiopia and the South Wind. As for the fathomless depth of the source, he said that Psammetichos king of Egypt came to a trial of this matter; for he had a rope twisted of many thousands of fathoms and let it down in this place, and it found no bottom. By this the scribe (if this which he told me was really as he said) gave me to understand 35 that there were certain strong eddies there and a backward flow, and that since the water dashed against the mountains, therefore the sounding-line could not come to any bottom when it was let down.

29. From no other person was I able to learn anything about this matter; but for the rest I learnt so much as here follows by the most diligent inquiry; 36 for I went myself as an eye-witness as far as the city of Elephantine and from that point onwards I gathered knowledge by report. From the city of Elephantine as one goes up the river there is country which slopes steeply; so that here one must attach ropes to the vessel on both sides, as one fastens an ox, and so make one's way onward; and if the rope break, the vessel is gone at once, carried away by the violence of the stream. Through this country it is a voyage of about four days in length, and in this part the Nile is winding like the river Maiander, and the distance amounts to twelve schoines, which one must traverse in this manner. Then you will come to a level plain, in which the Nile flows round an island named Tachompso. (Now in the regions above Elephantine there dwell Ethiopians at once succeeding, who also occupy half of the island, 37and Egyptians the other half.) Adjoining this island there is a great lake, round which dwell Ethiopian nomad tribes; and when you have sailed through this you will come to the stream of the Nile again, which flows into this lake. After this you will disembark and make a journey by land of forty days; for in the Nile sharp rocks stand forth out of the water, and there are many reefs, by which it is not possible for a vessel to pass. Then after having passed through this country in the forty days which I have said, you will embark again in another vessel and sail for twelve days; and after this you will come to a great city called Meroe. This city is said to be the mother-city of all the other Ethiopians: and they who dwell in it reverence of the gods Zeus and Dionysos alone, and these they greatly honour; and they have an Oracle of Zeus established, and make warlike marches whensoever this god commands them by prophesyings and to whatsoever place he commands.

30. Sailing from this city you will come to the ""Deserters"" in another period of time equal to that in which you came from Elephantine to the mother-city of the Ethiopians. Now the name of these ""Deserters"" is Asmach, and this word signifies, when translated into the tongue of the Hellenes, ""those who stand on the left hand of the king."" These were two hundred and forty thousand Egyptians of the warrior class, who revolted and went over to the Ethiopians for the following cause:‚ÄîIn the reign of Psammetichos garrisons were set, one towards the Ethiopians at the city of Elephantine, another towards the Arabians and Assyrians at Daphnai of Pelusion, and another towards Libya at Marea: and even in my own time the garrisons of the Persians too are ordered in the same manner as these were in the reign of Psammetichos, for both at Elephantine and at Daphnai the Persians have outposts. The Egyptians then of whom I speak had served as outposts for three years and no one relieved them from their guard; accordingly they took counsel together, and adopting a common plan they all in a body revolted from Psammetichos and set out for Ethiopia. Hearing this Psammetichos set forth in pursuit, and when he came up with them he entreated them much and endeavoured to persuade them not to desert the gods of their country and their children and wives: upon which it is said that one of them pointed to his privy member and said that wherever this was, there would they have both children and wives. When these came to Ethiopia they gave themselves over to the king of the Ethiopians; and he rewarded them as follows:‚Äîthere were certain of the Ethiopians who had come to be at variance with him; and he bade them drive these out and dwell in their land. So since these men settled in the land of the Ethiopians, the Ethiopians have come to be of milder manners, from having learnt the customs of the Egyptians.

31. The Nile then, besides that part of its course which is in Egypt, is known as far as a four months' journey by river and land: for that is the number of months which are found by reckoning to be spent in going from Elephantine to these ""Deserters"": and the river runs from the West and the setting of the sun. But what comes after that no one can clearly say; for this land is desert by reason of the burning heat.


32. Thus much however I heard from men of Kyrene, who told me that they had been to the Oracle of Ammon, and had come to speech with Etearchos king of the Ammonians: and it happened that after speaking of other matters they fell to discourse about the Nile and how no one knew the sources of it; and Etearchos said that once there had come to him men of the Nasamonians (this is a Libyan race which dwells in the Syrtis, and also in the land to the East of the Syrtis reaching to no great distance), and when the Nasamonians came and were asked by him whether they were able to tell him anything more than he knew about the desert parts of Libya, they said that there had been among them certain sons of chief men, who were of unruly disposition; and these when they grew up to be men had devised various other extravagant things and also they had told off by lot five of themselves to go to see the desert parts of Libya and to try whether they could discover more than those who had previously explored furthest: for in those parts of Libya which are by the Northern Sea, beginning from Egypt and going as far as the headland of Soloeis, which is the extreme point of Libya, Libyans (and of them many races) extend along the whole coast, except so much as the Hellenes and Phenicians hold; but in the upper parts, which lie above the sea-coast and above those people whose land comes down to the sea, Libya is full of wild beasts; and in the parts above the land of wild beasts it is full of sand, terribly waterless and utterly desert. These young men then (said they), being sent out by their companions well furnished with supplies of water and provisions, went first through the inhabited country, and after they had passed through this they came to the country of wild beasts, and after this they passed through the desert, making their journey towards the West Wind; and having passed through a great tract of sand in many days, they saw at last trees growing in a level place; and having come up to them, they were beginning to pluck the fruit which was upon the trees: but as they began to pluck it, there came upon them small men, of less stature than men of the common size, and these seized them and carried them away; and neither could the Nasamonians understand anything of their speech nor could those who were carrying them off understand anything of the speech of the Nasamonians: and they led them (so it was said) through very great swamps, and after passing through these they came to a city in which all the men were in size like those who carried them off and in colour of skin black; and by the city ran a great river, which ran from the West towards the sunrising, and in it were seen crocodiles.

33. Of the account given by Etearchos the Ammonian let so much suffice as is here said, except that, as the men of Kyrene told me, he alleged that the Nasamonians returned safe home, and that the people to whom they had come were all wizards. Now this river which ran by the city, Etearchos conjectured to be the Nile, and moreover reason compels us to think so; for the Nile flows from Libya and cuts Libya through in the midst, and as I conjecture, judging of what is not known by that which is evident to the view, it starts at a distance from its mouth equal to that of the Ister: for the river Ister begins from the Keltoi and the city of Pyrene and so runs that it divides Europe in the midst (now the Keltoi are outside the Pillars of Heracles and border upon the Kynesians, who dwell furthest towards the sunset of all those who have their dwelling in Europe); and the Ister ends, having its course through the whole of Europe, by flowing into the Euxine Sea at the place where the Milesians have their settlement of Istria.


34. Now the Ister, since it flows through land which is inhabited, is known by the reports of many; but of the sources of the Nile no one can give an account, for the part of Libya through which it flows is uninhabited and desert. About its course however so much as it was possible to learn by the most diligent inquiry has been told; and it runs out into Egypt. Now Egypt lies nearly opposite to the mountain districts of Kilikia; and from thence to Sinope, which lies upon the Euxine Sea, is a journey in the same straight line of five days for a man without encumbrance; 3701 and Sinope lies opposite to the place where the Ister runs out into the sea: thus I think that the Nile passes through the whole of Libya and is of equal measure with the Ister.
Of the Nile then let so much suffice as has been said.

35. Of Egypt however I shall make my report at length, because it has wonders more in number than any other land, and works too it has to show as much as any land, which are beyond expression great: for this reason then more shall be said concerning it.

The Egyptians in agreement with their climate, which is unlike any other, and with the river, which shows a nature different from all other rivers, established for themselves manners and customs in a way opposite to other men in almost all matters: for among them the women frequent the market and carry on trade, while the men remain at home and weave; and whereas others weave pushing the woof upwards, the Egyptians push it downwards: the men carry their burdens upon their heads and the women upon their shoulders: the women make water standing up and the men crouching down: they ease themselves in their houses and they eat without in the streets, alleging as reason for this that it is right to do secretly the things that are unseemly though necessary, but those which are not unseemly, in public: no woman is a minister either of male or female divinity, but men of all, both male and female: to support their parents the sons are in no way compelled, if they do not desire to do so, but the daughters are forced to do so, be they never so unwilling.

36. The priests of the gods in other lands wear long hair, but in Egypt they shave their heads: among other men the custom is that in mourning those whom the matter concerns most nearly have their hair cut short, but the Egyptians, when deaths occur, let their hair grow long, both that on the head and that on the chin, having before been close shaven: other men have their daily living separated from beasts, but the Egyptians have theirs together with beasts: other men live on wheat and barley, but to any one of the Egyptians who makes his living on these it is a great reproach; they make their bread of maize, 38 which some call spelt; 39 they knead dough with their feet and clay with their hands, with which also they gather up dung: and whereas other men, except such as have learnt otherwise from the Egyptians, have their members as nature made them, the Egyptians practise circumcision: as to garments, the men wear two each and the women but one: and whereas others make fast the rings and ropes of the sails outside the ship, the Egyptians do this inside: finally in the writing of characters and reckoning with pebbles, while the Hellenes carry the hand from the left to the right, the Egyptians do this from the right to the left; and doing so they say that they do it themselves rightwise and the Hellenes leftwise: and they use two kinds of characters for writing, of which the one kind is called sacred and the other common. 40

37. They are religious excessively beyond all other men, and with regard to this they have customs as follows:‚Äîthey drink from cups of bronze and rinse them out every day, and not some only do this but all: they wear garments of linen always newly washed, and this they make a special point of practice: they circumcise themselves for the sake of cleanliness, preferring to be clean rather than comely. The priests shave themselves all over their body every other day, so that no lice or any other foul thing may come to be upon them when they minister to the gods; and the priests wear garments of linen only and sandals of papyrus, and any other garment they may not take nor other sandals; these wash themselves in cold water twice in the day and twice again in the night; and other religious services they perform (one may almost say) of infinite number. 41 They enjoy also good things not a few, for they do not consume or spend anything of their own substance, but there is sacred bread baked for them and they have each great quantity of flesh of oxen and geese coming in to them each day, and also wine of grapes is given to them; but it is not permitted to them to taste of fish: beans moreover the Egyptians do not at all sow in their land, and those which grow they neither eat raw nor boil for food; nay the priests do not endure even to look upon them, thinking this to be an unclean kind of pulse: and there is not one priest only for each of the gods but many, and of them one is chief-priest, and whenever a priest dies his son is appointed to his place.

38. The males of the ox kind they consider to belong to Epaphos, and on account of him they test them in the following manner:‚ÄîIf the priest sees one single black hair upon the beast he counts it not clean for sacrifice; and one of the priests who is appointed for the purpose makes investigation of these matters, both when the beast is standing upright and when it is lying on its back, drawing out its tongue moreover, to see if it is clean in respect of the appointed signs, which I shall tell of in another part of the history: 42 he looks also at the hairs of the tail to see if it has them growing in the natural manner: and if it be clean in respect of all these things, he marks it with a piece of papyrus, rolling this round the horns, and then when he has plastered sealing-earth over it he sets upon it the seal of his signet-ring, and after that they take the animal away. But for one who sacrifices a beast not sealed the penalty appointed is death.

39. In this way then the beast is tested; and their appointed manner of sacrifice is as follows:‚Äîthey lead the sealed beast to the altar where they happen to be sacrificing and then kindle a fire: after that, having poured libations of wine over the altar so that it runs down upon the victim and having called upon the god, they cut its throat, and having cut its throat they sever the head from the body. The body then of the beast they flay, but upon the head 43 they make many imprecations first, and then they who have a market and Hellenes sojourning among them for trade, these carry it to the market-place and sell it, while they who have no Hellenes among them cast it away into the river: and this is the form of imprecation which they utter upon the heads, praying that if any evil be about to befall either themselves who are offering sacrifice or the land of Egypt in general, it may come rather upon this head. Now as regards the heads of the beasts which are sacrificed and the pouring over them of the wine, all the Egyptians have the same customs equally for all their sacrifices; and by reason of this custom none of the Egyptians eat of the head either of this or of any other kind of animal:


40, but the manner of disembowelling the victims and of burning them is appointed among them differently for different sacrifices; I shall speak however of the sacrifices to that goddess whom they regard as the greatest of all, and to whom they celebrate the greatest feast.‚ÄîWhen they have flayed the bullock and made imprecation, they take out the whole of its lower entrails but leave in the body the upper entrails and the fat; and they sever from it the legs and the end of the loin and the shoulders and the neck: and this done, they fill the rest of the body of the animal with consecrated 44 loaves and honey and raisins and figs and frankincense and myrrh and every other kind of spices, and having filled it with these they offer it, pouring over it great abundance of oil. They make their sacrifice after fasting, and while the offerings are being burnt, they all beat themselves for mourning, and when they have finished beating themselves they set forth as a feast that which they left unburnt of the sacrifice.

41. The clean males then of the ox kind, both full-grown animals and calves, are sacrificed by all the Egyptians; the females however they may not sacrifice, but these are sacred to Isis; for the figure of Isis is in the form of a woman with cow's horns, just as the Hellenes present Io in pictures, and all the Egyptians without distinction reverence cows far more than any other kind of cattle; for which reason neither man nor woman of Egyptian race would kiss a man who is a Hellene on the mouth, nor will they use a knife or roasting-spits or a caldron belonging to a Hellene, nor taste of the flesh even of a clean animal if it has been cut with the knife of a Hellene. And the cattle of this kind which die they bury in the following manner:‚Äîthe females they cast into the river, but the males they bury, each people in the suburb of their town, with one of the horns, or sometimes both, protruding to mark the place; and when the bodies have rotted away and the appointed time comes on, then to each city comes a boat 45 from that which is called the island of Prosopitis (this is in the Delta, and the extent of its circuit is nine schoines). In this island of Prosopitis is situated, besides many other cities, that one from which the boats come to take up the bones of the oxen, and the name of the city is Atarbechis, and in it there is set up a holy temple of Aphrodite. From this city many go abroad in various directions, some to one city and others to another, and when they have dug up the bones of the oxen they carry them off, and coming together they bury them in one single place. In the same manner as they bury the oxen they bury also their other cattle when they die; for about them also they have the same law laid down, and these also they abstain from killing.

42. Now all who have a temple set up to the Theban Zeus or who are of the district of Thebes, these, I say, all sacrifice goats and abstain from sheep: for not all the Egyptians equally reverence the same gods, except only Isis and Osiris (who they say is Dionysos), these they all reverence alike: but they who have a temple of Mendes or belong to the Mendesian district, these abstain from goats and sacrifice sheep. Now the men of Thebes and those who after their example abstain from sheep, say that this custom was established among them for the cause which follows:‚ÄîHeracles (they say) had an earnest desire to see Zeus, and Zeus did not desire to be seen of him; and at last when Heracles was urgent in entreaty Zeus contrived this device, that is to say, he flayed a ram and held in front of him the head of the ram which he had cut off, and he put on over him the fleece and then showed himself to him. Hence the Egyptians make the image of Zeus into the face of a ram; and the Ammonians do so also after their example, being settlers both from the Egyptians and from the Ethiopians, and using a language which is a medley of both tongues: and in my opinion it is from this god that the Ammonians took the name which they have, for the Egyptians call Zeus Amun. The Thebans then do not sacrifice rams but hold them sacred for this reason; on one day however in the year, on the feast of Zeus, they cut up in the same manner and flay one single ram and cover with its skin the image of Zeus, and then they bring up to it another image of Heracles. This done, all who are in the temple beat themselves in lamentation for the ram, and then they bury it in a sacred tomb.

43. About Heracles I heard the account given that he was of the number of the twelve gods; but of the other Heracles whom the Hellenes know I was not able to hear in any part of Egypt: and moreover to prove that the Egyptians did not take the name of Heracles from the Hellenes, but rather the Hellenes from the Egyptians,‚Äîthat is to say those of the Hellenes who gave the name Heracles to the son of Amphitryon,‚Äîof that, I say, besides many other evidences there is chiefly this, namely that the parents of this Heracles, Amphitryon and Alcmene, were both of Egypt by descent, 46 and also that the Egyptians say that they do not know the names either of Poseidon or of the Dioscuroi, nor have these been accepted by them as gods among the other gods; whereas if they had received from the Hellenes the name of any divinity, they would naturally have preserved the memory of these most of all, assuming that in those times as now some of the Hellenes were wont to make voyages4601 and were sea-faring folk, as I suppose and as my judgment compels me to think; so that the Egyptians would have learnt the names of these gods even more than that of Heracles. In fact however Heracles is a very ancient Egyptian god; and (as they say themselves) it is seventeen thousand years to the beginning of the reign of Amasis from the time when the twelve gods, of whom they count that Heracles is one, were begotten of the eight gods.

44. I moreover, desiring to know something certain of these matters so far as might be, made a voyage also to Tyre of Phenicia, hearing that in that place there was a holy temple of Heracles; and I saw that it was richly furnished with many votive offerings besides, and especially there were in it two pillars, 47 the one of pure gold and the other of an emerald stone of such size as to shine by night: 48and having come to speech with the priests of the god, I asked them how long time it was since their temple had been set up: and these also I found to be at variance with the Hellenes, for they said that at the same time when Tyre was founded, the temple of the god also had been set up, and that it was a period of two thousand three hundred years since their people began to dwell at Tyre. I saw also at Tyre another temple of Heracles, with the surname Thasian; and I came to Thasos also and there I found a temple of Heracles set up by the Phenicians, who had sailed out to seek for Europa and had colonised Thasos; and these things happened full five generations of men before Heracles the son of Amphitryon was born in Hellas. So then my inquiries show clearly that Heracles is an ancient god, and those of the Hellenes seem to me to act most rightly who have two temples of Heracles set up, and who sacrifice to the one as an immortal god and with the title Olympian, and make offerings of the dead49 to the other as a hero.

45. Moreover, besides many other stories which the Hellenes tell without due consideration, this tale is especially foolish which they tell about Heracles, namely that when he came to Egypt, the Egyptians put on him wreaths and led him forth in procession to sacrifice him to Zeus; and he for some time kept quiet, but when they were beginning the sacrifice of him at the altar, he betook himself to prowess and slew them all. I for my part am of opinion that the Hellenes when they tell this tale are altogether without knowledge of the nature and customs of the Egyptians; for how should they for whom it is not lawful to sacrifice even beasts, except swine 50 and the males of oxen and calves (such of them as are clean) and geese, how should these sacrifice human beings? Besides this, how is it in nature possible that Heracles, being one person only and moreover a man (as they assert), should slay many myriads? Having said so much of these matters, we pray that we may have grace from both the gods and the heroes for our speech.

46. Now the reason why those of the Egyptians whom I have mentioned do not sacrifice goats, female or male, is this:‚Äîthe Mendesians count Pan to be one of the eight gods (now these eight gods they say came into being before the twelve gods), and the painters and image-makers represent in painting and in sculpture the figure of Pan, just as the Hellenes do, with goat's face and legs, not supposing him to be really like this but to resemble the other gods; the cause however why they represent him in this form I prefer not to say. The Mendesians then reverence all goats and the males more than the females (and the goatherds too have greater honour than other herdsmen), but of the goats one especially is reverenced, and when he dies there is great mourning in all the Mendesian district: and both the goat and Pan are called in the Egyptian tongue Mendes. Moreover in my lifetime there happened in that district this marvel, that is to say a he-goat had intercourse with a woman publicly, and this was so done that all men might have evidence of it.


47. The pig is accounted by the Egyptians an abominable animal; and first, if any of them in passing by touch a pig, he goes into the river and dips himself forthwith in the water together with his garments; and then too swineherds, though they be native Egyptians, unlike all others do not enter any of the temples in Egypt, nor is anyone willing to give his daughter in marriage to one of them or to take a wife from among them; but the swineherds both give in marriage to one another and take from one another. Now to the other gods the Egyptians do not think it right to sacrifice swine; but to the Moon and to Dionysos alone at the same time and on the same full-moon they sacrifice swine, and then eat their flesh: and as to the reason why, when they abominate swine at all their other feasts, they sacrifice them at this, there is a story told by the Egyptians; and this story I know, but it is not a seemly one for me to tell. Now the sacrifice of the swine to the Moon is performed as follows:‚Äîwhen the priest has slain the victim, he puts together the end of the tail and the spleen and the caul, and covers them up with the whole of the fat of the animal which is about the paunch, and then he offers them with fire; and the rest of the flesh they eat on that day of full moon upon which they have held the sacrifice, but on any day after this they will not taste of it: the poor however among them by reason of the scantiness of their means shape pigs of dough and having baked them they offer these as a sacrifice.

48. Then for Dionysos on the eve of the festival each one kills a pig by cutting its throat before his own doors, and after that he gives the pig to the swineherd who sold it to him, to carry away again; and the rest of the feast of Dionysos is celebrated by the Egyptians in the same way as by the Hellenes in almost all things except choral dances, but instead of the phallos they have invented another contrivance, namely figures of about a cubit in height worked by strings, which women carry about the villages, with the privy member made to move and not much less in size than the rest of the body: and a flute goes before and they follow singing the praises of Dionysos. As to the reason why the figure has this member larger than is natural and moves it, though it moves no other part of the body, about this there is a sacred story told.

49. Now I think that Melampus the son of Amytheon was not without knowledge of these rites of sacrifice, but was acquainted with them: for Melampus is he who first set forth to the Hellenes the name of Dionysos and the manner of sacrifice and the procession of the phallos. Strictly speaking indeed, he when he made it known did not take in the whole, but those wise men who came after him made it known more at large. Melampus then is he who taught of the phallos which is carried in procession for Dionysos, and from him the Hellenes learnt to do that which they do. I say then that Melampus being a man of ability contrived for himself an art of divination, and having learnt from Egypt he taught the Hellenes many things, and among them those that concern Dionysos, making changes in some few points of them: for I shall not say that that which is done in worship of the god in Egypt came accidentally to be the same with that which is done among the Hellenes, for then these rites would have been in character with the Hellenic worship and not lately brought in; nor certainly shall I say that the Egyptians took from the Hellenes either this or any other customary observance: but I think it most probable that Melampus learnt the matters concerning Dionysos from Cadmos the Tyrian and from those who came with him from Phenicia to the land which we now call Boeotia.

50. Moreover the naming 51 of almost all the gods has come to Hellas from Egypt: for that it has come from the Barbarians I find by inquiry is true, and I am of opinion that most probably it has come from Egypt, because, except in the case of Poseidon and the Dioscuroi (in accordance with that which I have said before), and also of Hera and Hestia and Themis and the Charites and Nere√Øds, the Egyptians have had the names of all the other gods in their country for all time. What I say here is that which the Egyptians think themselves: but as for the gods whose names they profess that they do not know, these I think received their naming from the Pelasgians, except Poseidon; but about this god the Hellenes learnt from the Libyans, for no people except the Libyans have had the name of Poseidon from the first and have paid honour to this god always. Nor, it may be added, have the Egyptians any custom of worshipping heroes.
51. These observances then, and others besides these which I shall mention, the Hellenes have adopted from the Egyptians; but to make, as they do, the images of Hermes with the phallos they have learnt not from the Egyptians but from the Pelasgians, the custom having been received by the Athenians first of all the Hellenes and from these by the rest; for just at the time when the Athenians were beginning to rank among the Hellenes, the Pelasgians became dwellers with them in their land, and from this very cause it was that they began to be counted as Hellenes. Whosoever has been initiated in the mysteries of the Cabeiroi, which the Samothrakians perform having received them from the Pelasgians, that man knows the meaning of my speech; for these very Pelasgians who became dwellers with the Athenians used to dwell before that time in Samothrake, and from them the Samothrakians received their mysteries. So then the Athenians were the first of the Hellenes who made the images of Hermes with the phallos, having learnt from the Pelasgians; and the Pelasgians told a sacred story about it, which is set forth in the mysteries in Samothrake.

52. Now the Pelasgians formerly were wont to make all their sacrifices calling upon the gods in prayer, as I know from that which I heard at Dodona, but they gave no title or name to any of them, for they had not yet heard any, but they called them gods ({theous}) from some such notion as this, that they had set ({thentes}) in order all things and so had the distribution of everything. Afterwards, when much time had elapsed, they learnt from Egypt the names of the gods, all except Dionysos, for his name they learnt long afterwards; and after a time the Pelasgians consulted the Oracle at Dodona about the names, for this prophetic seat is accounted to be the most ancient of the Oracles which are among the Hellenes, and at that time it was the only one. So when the Pelasgians asked the Oracle at Dodona whether they should adopt the names which had come from the Barbarians, the Oracle in reply bade them make use of the names. From this time they sacrificed using the names of the gods, and from the Pelasgians the Hellenes afterwards received them:

53, but whence the several gods had their birth, or whether they all were from the beginning, and of what form they are, they did not learn till yesterday, as it were, or the day before: for Hesiod and Homer I suppose were four hundred years before my time and not more, and these are they who made a theogony for the Hellenes and gave the titles to the gods and distributed to them honours and arts, and set forth their forms: but the poets who are said to have been before these men were really in my opinion after them. Of these things the first are said by the priestesses of Dodona, and the latter things, those namely which have regard to Hesiod and Homer, by myself.

54. As regards the Oracles both that among the Hellenes and that in Libya, the Egyptians tell the following tale. The priests of the Theban Zeus told me that two women in the service of the temple had been carried away from Thebes by Phenicians, and that they had heard that one of them had been sold to go into Libya and the other to the Hellenes; and these women, they said, were they who first founded the prophetic seats among the nations which have been named: and when I inquired whence they knew so perfectly of this tale which they told, they said in reply that a great search had been made by the priests after these women, and that they had not been able to find them, but they had heard afterwards this tale about them which they were telling.

55. This I heard from the priests at Thebes, and what follows is said by the prophetesses 52 of Dodona. They say that two black doves flew from Thebes to Egypt, and came one of them to Libya and the other to their land. And this latter settled upon an oak-tree 53 and spoke with human voice, saying that it was necessary that a prophetic seat of Zeus should be established in that place; and they supposed that that was of the gods which was announced to them, and made one accordingly: and the dove which went away to the Libyans, they say, bade the Libyans to make an Oracle of Ammon; and this also is of Zeus. The priestesses of Dodona told me these things, of whom the eldest was named Promeneia, the next after her Timarete, and the youngest Nicandra; and the other people of Dodona who were engaged about the temple gave accounts agreeing with theirs.

56. I however have an opinion about the matter as follows:‚ÄîIf the Phenicians did in truth carry away the consecrated women and sold one of them into Libya and the other into Hellas, I suppose that in the country now called Hellas, which was formerly called Pelasgia, this woman was sold into the land of the Thesprotians; and then being a slave there she set up a sanctuary of Zeus under a real oak-tree; 54 as indeed it was natural that being an attendant of the sanctuary of Zeus at Thebes, she should there, in the place to which she had come, have a memory of him; and after this, when she got understanding of the Hellenic tongue, she established an Oracle, and she reported, I suppose, that her sister had been sold in Libya by the same Phenicians by whom she herself had been sold.

57. Moreover, I think that the women were called doves by the people of Dodona for the reason that they were Barbarians and because it seemed to them that they uttered voice like birds; but after a time (they say) the dove spoke with human voice, that is when the woman began to speak so that they could understand; but so long as she spoke a Barbarian tongue she seemed to them to be uttering voice like a bird: for had it been really a dove, how could it speak with human voice? And in saying that the dove was black, they indicate that the woman was Egyptian. The ways of delivering oracles too at Thebes in Egypt and at Dodona closely resemble one another, as it happens, and also the method of divination by victims has come from Egypt.

58. Moreover, it is true also that the Egyptians were the first of men who made solemn assemblies 55 and processions and approaches to the temples, 56 and from them the Hellenes have learnt them, and my evidence for this is that the Egyptian celebrations of these have been held from a very ancient time, whereas the Hellenic were introduced 57 but lately.

59. The Egyptians hold their solemn assemblies not once in the year but often, especially and with the greatest zeal and devotion 58 at the city of Bubastis for Artemis, and next at Busiris for Isis; for in this last-named city there is a very great temple of Isis, and this city stands in the middle of the Delta of Egypt; now Isis is in the tongue of the Hellenes Demeter: thirdly, they have a solemn assembly at the city of Sa√Øs for Athene, fourthly at Heliopolis for the Sun (Helios), fifthly at the city of Buto in honour of Leto, and sixthly at the city of Papremis for Ares.

60. Now, when they are coming to the city of Bubastis they do as follows:‚Äîthey sail men and women together, and a great multitude of each sex in every boat; and some of the women have rattles and rattle with them, while some of the men play the flute during the whole time of the voyage, and the rest, both women and men, sing and clap their hands; and when as they sail they come opposite to any city on the way they bring the boat to land, and some of the women continue to do as I have said, others cry aloud and jeer at the women in that city, some dance, and some stand up and pull up their garments. This they do by every city along the river-bank; and when they come to Bubastis they hold festival celebrating great sacrifices, and more wine of grapes is consumed upon that festival than during the whole of the rest of the year. To this place (so say the natives) they come together year by year 59 even to the number of seventy myriads 5901 of men and women, besides children.
61. Thus it is done here; and how they celebrate the festival in honour of Isis at the city of Busiris has been told by me before: 60 for, as I said, they beat themselves in mourning after the sacrifice, all of them both men and women, very many myriads of people; but for whom they beat themselves it is not permitted to me by religion to say: and so many as there are of the Carians dwelling in Egypt do this even more than the Egyptians themselves, inasmuch as they cut their foreheads also with knives; and by this it is manifested that they are strangers and not Egyptians.

62. At the times when they gather together at the city of Sa√Øs for their sacrifices, on a certain night 61 they all kindle lamps many in number in the open air round about the houses; now the lamps are saucers full of salt and oil mixed, and the wick floats by itself on the surface, and this burns during the whole night; and to the festival is given the name Lychnocaia (the lighting of the lamps). Moreover those of the Egyptians who have not come to this solemn assembly observe the night of the festival and themselves also light lamps all of them, and thus not in Sa√Øs alone are they lighted, but over all Egypt: and as to the reason why light and honour are allotted to this night, 62 about this there is a sacred story told.

63. To Heliopolis and Buto they go year by year and do sacrifice only: but at Papremis they do sacrifice and worship as elsewhere, and besides that, when the sun begins to go down, while some few of the priests are occupied with the image of the god, the greater number of them stand in the entrance of the temple with wooden clubs, and other persons to the number of more than a thousand men with purpose to perform a vow, these also having all of them staves of wood, stand in a body opposite to those: and the image, which is in a small shrine of wood covered over with gold, they take out on the day before to another sacred building. The few then who have been left about the image, draw a wain with four wheels, which bears the shrine and the image that is within the shrine, and the other priests standing in the gateway try to prevent it from entering, and the men who are under a vow come to the assistance of the god and strike them, while the others defend themselves. 63 Then there comes to be a hard fight with staves, and they break one another's heads, and I am of opinion that many even die of the wounds they receive; the Egyptians however told me that no one died. This solemn assembly the people of the place say that they established for the following reason:‚Äîthe mother of Ares, they say, used to dwell in this temple, and Ares, having been brought up away from her, when he grew up came thither desiring to visit his mother, and the attendants of his mother's temple, not having seen him before, did not permit him to pass in, but kept him away; and he brought men to help him from another city and handled roughly the attendants of the temple, and entered to visit his mother. Hence, they say, this exchange of blows has become the custom in honour of Ares upon his festival.

64. The Egyptians were the first who made it a point of religion not to lie with women in temples, nor to enter into temples after going away from women without first bathing: for almost all other men except the Egyptians and the Hellenes lie with women in temples and enter into a temple after going away from women without bathing, since they hold that there is no difference in this respect between men and beasts: for they say that they see beasts and the various kinds of birds coupling together both in the temples and in the sacred enclosures of the gods; if then this were not pleasing to the god, the beasts would not do so.

65. Thus do these defend that which they do, which by me is disallowed: but the Egyptians are excessively careful in their observances, both in other matters which concern the sacred rites and also in those which follow:‚ÄîEgypt, though it borders upon Libya, 6301 does not very much abound in wild animals, but such as they have are one and all accounted by them sacred, some of them living with men and others not. But if I should say for what reasons the sacred animals have been thus dedicated, I should fall into discourse of matters pertaining to the gods, of which I most desire not to speak; and what I have actually said touching slightly upon them, I said because I was constrained by necessity. About these animals there is a custom of this kind:‚Äîpersons have been appointed of the Egyptians, both men and women, to provide the food for each kind of beast separately, and their office goes down from father to son; and those who dwell in the various cities perform vows to them thus, that is, when they make a vow to the god to whom the animal belongs, they shave the head of their children either the whole or the half or the third part of it, and then set the hair in the balance against silver, and whatever it weighs, this the man gives to the person who provides for the animals, and she cuts up fish of equal value and gives it for food to the animals. Thus food for their support has been appointed: and if any one kill any of these animals, the penalty, if he do it with his own will, is death, and if against his will, such penalty as the priests may appoint: but whosoever shall kill an ibis or a hawk, whether it be with his will or against his will, must die.

66. Of the animals that live with men there are great numbers, and would be many more but for the accidents which befall the cats. For when the females have produced young they are no longer in the habit of going to the males, and these seeking to be united with them are not able. To this end then they contrive as follows,‚Äîthey either take away by force or remove secretly the young from the females and kill them (but after killing they do not eat them), and the females being deprived of their young and desiring more, therefore come to the males, for it is a creature that is fond of its young. Moreover when a fire occurs, the cats seem to be divinely possessed; 64 for while the Egyptians stand at intervals and look after the cats, not taking any care to extinguish the fire, the cats slipping through or leaping over the men, jump into the fire; and when this happens, great mourning comes upon the Egyptians. And in whatever houses a cat has died by a natural death, all those who dwell in this house shave their eyebrows only, but those in whose houses a dog has died shave their whole body and also their head.

67. The cats when they are dead are carried away to sacred buildings in the city of Bubastis, where after being embalmed they are buried; but the dogs they bury each people in their own city in sacred tombs; and the ichneumons are buried just in the same way as the dogs. The shrew-mice however and the hawks they carry away to the city of Buto, and the ibises to Hermopolis; 65 the bears (which are not commonly seen) and the wolves, not much larger in size than foxes, they bury on the spot where they are found lying.

68. Of the crocodile the nature is as follows:‚Äîduring the four most wintry months this creature eats nothing: she has four feet and is an animal belonging to the land and the water both; for she produces and hatches eggs on the land, and the most part of the day she remains upon dry land, but the whole of the night in the river, for the water in truth is warmer than the unclouded open air and the dew. Of all the mortal creatures of which we have knowledge this grows to the greatest bulk from the smallest beginning; for the eggs which she produces are not much larger than those of geese and the newly-hatched young one is in proportion to the egg, but as he grows he becomes as much as seventeen cubits long and sometimes yet larger. He has eyes like those of a pig and teeth large and tusky, in proportion to the size of his body; but unlike all other beasts he grows no tongue, neither does he move his lower jaw, but brings the upper jaw towards the lower, being in this too unlike all other beasts. He has moreover strong claws and a scaly hide upon his back which cannot be pierced; and he is blind in the water, but in the air he is of very keen sight. Since he has his living in the water he keeps his mouth all full within of leeches; and whereas all other birds and beasts fly from him, the trochilus is a creature which is at peace with him, seeing that from her he receives benefit; for the crocodile having come out of the water to the land and then having opened his mouth (this he is wont to do generally towards the West Wind), the trochilus upon that enters into his mouth and swallows down the leeches, and he being benefited is pleased and does no harm to the trochilus.

69. Now for some of the Egyptians the crocodiles are sacred animals, and for others not so, but they treat them on the contrary as enemies: those however who dwell about Thebes and about the lake of Moiris hold them to be most sacred, and each of these two peoples keeps one crocodile selected from the whole number, which has been trained to tameness, and they put hanging ornaments of molten stone and of gold into the ears of these and anklets round the front feet, and they give them food appointed and victims of sacrifices and treat them as well as possible while they live, and after they are dead they bury them in sacred tombs, embalming them: but those who dwell about the city of Elephantine even eat them, not holding them to be sacred. They are called not crocodiles but champsai, and the Ionians gave them the name of crocodile, comparing their form to that of the crocodiles (lizards) which appear in their country in the stone walls.

70. There are many ways in use of catching them and of various kinds: I shall describe that which to me seems the most worthy of being told. A man puts the back of a pig upon a hook as bait, and lets it go into the middle of the river, while he himself upon the bank of the river has a young live pig, which he beats; and the crocodile hearing its cries makes for the direction of the sound, and when he finds the pig's back he swallows it down: then they pull, and when he is drawn out to land, first of all the hunter forthwith plasters up his eyes with mud, and having so done he very easily gets the mastery of him, but if he does not do so he has much trouble.

71. The river-horse is sacred in the district of Papremis, but for the other Egyptians he is not sacred; and this is the appearance which he presents: he is four-footed, cloven-hoofed like an ox, 66 flat-nosed, with a mane like a horse and showing teeth like tusks, with a tail and voice like a horse, and in size as large as the largest ox; and his hide is so exceedingly thick that when it has been dried shafts of javelins are made of it.

72. There are moreover otters in the river, which they consider to be sacred; and of fish also they esteem that which is called the lepidotos to be sacred, and also the eel; and these they say are sacred to the Nile: and of birds the fox-goose.

73. There is also another sacred bird called the phoenix which I did not myself see except in painting, for in truth he comes to them very rarely, at intervals, as the people of Heliopolis say, of five hundred years; and these say that he comes regularly when his father dies; and if he be like the painting, he is of this size and nature, that is to say, some of his feathers are of gold colour and others red, and in outline and size he is as nearly as possible like an eagle. This bird they say (but I cannot believe the story) contrives as follows:‚Äîsetting forth from Arabia he conveys his father, they say, to the temple of the Sun (Helios) plastered up in myrrh, and buries him in the temple of the Sun; and he conveys him thus:‚Äîhe forms first an egg of myrrh as large as he is able to carry, and then he makes trial of carrying it, and when he has made trial sufficiently, then he hollows out the egg and places his father within it and plasters over with other myrrh that part of the egg where he hollowed it out to put his father in, and when his father is laid in it, it proves (they say) to be of the same weight as it was; and after he has plastered it up, he conveys the whole to Egypt to the temple of the Sun. Thus they say that this bird does.

74. There are also about Thebes sacred serpents, not at all harmful to men, which are small in size and have two horns growing from the top of the head: these they bury when they die in the temple of Zeus, for to this god they say that they are sacred.

75. There is a region moreover in Arabia, situated nearly over against the city of Buto, to which place I came to inquire about the winged serpents: and when I came thither I saw bones of serpents and spines in quantity so great that it is impossible to make report of the number, and there were heaps of spines, some heaps large and others less large and others smaller still than these, and these heaps were many in number. This region in which the spines are scattered upon the ground is of the nature of an entrance from a narrow mountain pass to a great plain, which plain adjoins the plain of Egypt; and the story goes that at the beginning of spring winged serpents from Arabia fly towards Egypt, and the birds called ibises meet them at the entrance to this country and do not suffer the serpents to go by but kill them. On account of this deed it is (say the Arabians) that the ibis has come to be greatly honoured by the Egyptians, and the Egyptians also agree that it is for this reason that they honour these birds.

76. The outward form of the ibis is this:‚Äîit is a deep black all over, and has legs like those of a crane and a very curved beak, and in size it is about equal to a rail: this is the appearance of the black kind which fight with the serpents, but of those which most crowd round men's feet (for there are two several kinds of ibises) the head is bare and also the whole of the throat, and it is white in feathering except the head and neck and the extremities of the wings and the rump (in all these parts of which I have spoken it is a deep black), while in legs and in the form of the head it resembles the other. As for the serpent its form is like that of the watersnake; and it has wings not feathered but most nearly resembling the wings of the bat. Let so much suffice as has been said now concerning sacred animals.


77. Of the Egyptians themselves, those who dwell in the part of Egypt which is sown for crops 67 practise memory more than any other men and are the most learned in history by far of all those of whom I have had experience: and their manner of life is as follows:‚ÄîFor three successive days in each month they purge, hunting after health with emetics and clysters, and they think that all the diseases which exist are produced in men by the food on which they live; for the Egyptians are from other causes also the most healthy of all men next after the Libyans (in my opinion on account of the seasons, because the seasons do not change, for by the changes of things generally, and especially of the seasons, diseases are most apt to be produced in men), and as to their diet, it is as follows:‚Äîthey eat bread, making loaves of maize, which they call kyllestis, and they use habitually a wine made out of barley, for vines they have not in their land. Of their fish some they dry in the sun and then eat them without cooking, others they eat cured in brine. Of birds they eat quails and ducks and small birds without cooking, after first curing them; and everything else which they have belonging to the class of birds or fishes, except such as have been set apart by them as sacred, they eat roasted or boiled.

78. In the entertainments of the rich among them, when they have finished eating, a man bears round a wooden figure of a dead body in a coffin, made as like the reality as may be both by painting and carving, and measuring about a cubit or two cubits each way; 68 and this he shows to each of those who are drinking together, saying: ""When thou lookest upon this, drink and be merry, for thou shalt be such as this when thou art dead."" Thus they do at their carousals.

79. The customs which they practise are derived from their fathers and they do not acquire others in addition; but besides other customary things among them which are worthy of mention, they have one song, 6801 that of Linos, the same who is sung of both in Phenicia and in Cyprus and elsewhere, having however a name different according to the various nations. This song agrees exactly with that which the Hellenes sing calling on the name of Linos, 69 so that besides many other things about which I wonder among those matters which concern Egypt, I wonder especially about this, namely whence they got the song of Linos. 70 It is evident however that they have sung this song from immemorial time, and in the Egyptian tongue Linos is called Maneros. The Egyptians told me that he was the only son of him who first became king of Egypt, and that he died before his time and was honoured with these lamentations by the Egyptians, and that this was their first and only song.

80. In another respect the Egyptians are in agreement with some of the Hellenes, namely with the Lacedemonians, but not with the rest, that is to say, the younger of them when they meet the elder give way and move out of the path, and when their elders approach they rise out of their seat. In this which follows however they are not in agreement with any of the Hellenes,‚Äîinstead of addressing one another in the roads they do reverence, lowering their hand down to their knee.

81. They wear tunics of linen about their legs with fringes, which they call calasiris; above these they have garments of white wool thrown over: woollen garments however are not taken into the temples, nor are they buried with them, for this is not permitted by religion. In these points they are in agreement with the observances called Orphic and Bacchic (which are really Egyptian), 71 and also with those of the Pythagoreans, for one who takes part in these mysteries is also forbidden by religious rule to be buried in woollen garments; and about this there is a sacred story told.

82. Besides these things the Egyptians have found out also to what god each month and each day belongs, and what fortunes a man will meet with who is born on any particular day, and how he will die, and what kind of a man he will be: and these inventions were taken up by those of the Hellenes who occupied themselves about poesy. Portents too have been found out by them more than by all other men besides; for when a portent has happened, they observe and write down the event which comes of it, and if ever afterwards anything resembling this happens, they believe that the event which comes of it will be similar.
83. Their divination is ordered thus:‚Äîthe art is assigned not to any man, but to certain of the gods, for there are in their land Oracles of Heracles, of Apollo, of Athene, of Artemis, of Ares, and of Zeus, and moreover that which they hold most in honour of all, namely the Oracle of Leto which is in the city of Buto. The manner of divination however is not yet established among them according to the same fashion everywhere, but is different in different places.

84. The art of medicine among them is distributed thus:‚Äîeach physician is a physician of one disease and of no more; and the whole country is full of physicians, for some profess themselves to be physicians of the eyes, others of the head, others of the teeth, others of the affections of the stomach, and others of the more obscure ailments.

85. Their fashions of mourning and of burial are these:‚ÄîWhenever any household has lost a man who is of any regard amongst them, the whole number of women of that house forthwith plaster over their heads or even their faces with mud. Then leaving the corpse within the house they go themselves to and fro about the city and beat themselves, with their garments bound up by a girdle 72 and their breasts exposed, and with them go all the women who are related to the dead man, and on the other side the men beat themselves, they too having their garments bound up by a girdle; and when they have done this, they then convey the body to the embalming.

86. In this occupation certain persons employ themselves regularly and inherit this as a craft. These, whenever a corpse is conveyed to them, show to those who brought it wooden models of corpses made like reality by painting, and the best of the ways of embalming they say is that of him whose name I think it impiety to mention when speaking of a matter of such a kind; 73 the second which they show is less good than this and also less expensive; and the third is the least expensive of all. Having told them about this, they inquire of them in which way they desire the corpse of their friend to be prepared. Then they after they have agreed for a certain price depart out of the way, and the others being left behind in the buildings embalm according to the best of these ways thus:‚ÄîFirst with a crooked iron tool they draw out the brain through the nostrils, extracting it partly thus and partly by pouring in drugs; and after this with a sharp stone of Ethiopia they make a cut along the side and take out the whole contents of the belly, and when they have cleared out the cavity and cleansed it with palm-wine they cleanse it again with spices pounded up: then they fill the belly with pure myrrh pounded up and with cassia and other spices except frankincense, and sew it together again. Having so done they keep it for embalming covered up in natron for seventy days, but for a longer time than this it is not permitted to embalm it; and when the seventy days are past, they wash the corpse and roll its whole body up in fine linen 74 cut into bands, smearing these beneath with gum, 75 which the Egyptians use generally instead of glue. Then the kinsfolk receive it from them and have a wooden figure made in the shape of a man, and when they have had this made they enclose the corpse, and having shut it up within, they store it then in a sepulchral chamber, setting it to stand upright against the wall.

87. Thus they deal with the corpses which are prepared in the most costly way; but for those who desire the middle way and wish to avoid great cost they prepare the corpse as follows:‚Äîhaving filled their syringes with the oil which is got from cedar-wood, with this they forthwith fill the belly of the corpse, and this they do without having either cut it open or taken out the bowels, but they inject the oil by the breech, and having stopped the drench from returning back they keep it then the appointed number of days for embalming, and on the last of the days they let the cedar oil come out from the belly, which they before put in; and it has such power that it brings out with it the bowels and interior organs of the body dissolved; and the natron dissolves the flesh, so that there is left of the corpse only the skin and the bones. When they have done this they give back the corpse at once in that condition without working upon it any more.

88. The third kind of embalming, by which are prepared the bodies of those who have less means, is as follows:‚Äîthey cleanse out the belly with a purge and then keep the body for embalming during the seventy days, and at once after that they give it back to the bringers to carry away.

89. The wives of men of rank when they die are not given at once to be embalmed, nor such women as are very beautiful or of greater regard than others, but on the third or fourth day after their death (and not before) they are delivered to the embalmers. They do so about this matter in order that the embalmers may not abuse their women, for they say that one of them was taken once doing so to the corpse of a woman lately dead, and his fellow-craftsman gave information.

90. Whenever any one, either of the Egyptians themselves or of strangers, is found to have been carried off by a crocodile or brought to his death by the river itself, the people of any city by which he may have been cast up on land must embalm him and lay him out in the fairest way they can and bury him in a sacred burial-place, nor may any of his relations or friends besides touch him, but the priests of the Nile themselves handle the corpse and bury it as that of one who was something more than man.

91. Hellenic usages they will by no means follow, and to speak generally they follow those of no other men whatever. This rule is observed by most of the Egyptians; but there is a large city named Chemmis in the Theban district near Neapolis, and in this city there is a temple of Perseus the son of Danae which is of a square shape, and round it grow date-palms: the gateway of the temple is built of stone and of very great size, and at the entrance of it stand two great statues of stone. Within this enclosure is a temple-house 76 and in it stands an image of Perseus. These people of Chemmis say that Perseus is wont often to appear in their land and often within the temple, and that a sandal which has been worn by him is found sometimes, being in length two cubits, and whenever this appears all Egypt prospers. This they say, and they do in honour of Perseus after Hellenic fashion thus,‚Äîthey hold an athletic contest, which includes the whole list of games, and they offer in prizes cattle and cloaks and skins: and when I inquired why to them alone Perseus was wont to appear, and wherefore they were separated from all the other Egyptians in that they held an athletic contest, they said that Perseus had been born of their city, for Danaos and Lynkeus were men of Chemmis and had sailed to Hellas, and from them they traced a descent and came down to Perseus: and they told me that he had come to Egypt for the reason which the Hellenes also say, namely to bring from Libya the Gorgon's head, and had then visited them also and recognised all his kinsfolk, and they said that he had well learnt the name of Chemmis before he came to Egypt, since he had heard it from his mother, and that they celebrated an athletic contest for him by his own command.

92. All these are customs practised by the Egyptians who dwell above the fens: and those who are settled in the fen-land have the same customs for the most part as the other Egyptians, both in other matters and also in that they live each with one wife only, as do the Hellenes; but for economy in respect of food they have invented these things besides:‚Äîwhen the river has become full and the plains have been flooded, there grow in the water great numbers of lilies, which the Egyptians call lotos; these they cut with a sickle and dry in the sun, and then they pound that which grows in the middle of the lotos and which is like the head of a poppy, and they make of it loaves baked with fire. The root also of this lotos is edible and has a rather sweet taste: 77 it is round in shape and about the size of an apple. There are other lilies too, in flower resembling roses, which also grow in the river, and from them the fruit is produced in a separate vessel springing from the root by the side of the plant itself, and very nearly resembles a wasp's comb: in this there grow edible seeds in great numbers of the size of an olive-stone, and they are eaten either fresh 78 or dried. Besides this they pull up from the fens the papyrus which grows every year, and the upper parts of it they cut off and turn to other uses, but that which is left below for about a cubit in length they eat or sell: and those who desire to have the papyrus at its very best bake it in an oven heated red-hot, and then eat it. Some too of these people live on fish alone, which they dry in the sun after having caught them and taken out the entrails, and then when they are dry, they use them for food.

93. Fish which swim in shoals are not much produced in the rivers, but are bred in the lakes, and they do as follows:‚ÄîWhen there comes upon them the desire to breed, they swim out in shoals towards the sea; and the males lead the way shedding forth their milt as they go, while the females, coming after and swallowing it up, from it become impregnated: and when they have become full of young in the sea they swim up back again, each shoal to its own haunts. The same however no longer lead the way as before, but the lead comes now to the females, and they leading the way in shoals do just as the males did, that is to say they shed forth their eggs by a few grains at a time, 79 and the males coming after swallow them up. Now these grains are fish, and from the grains which survive and are not swallowed, the fish grow which afterwards are bred up. Now those of the fish which are caught as they swim out to sea are found to be rubbed on the left side of the head, but those which are caught as they swim up again are rubbed on the right side. This happens to them because as they swim down to the sea they keep close to the land on the left side of the river, and again as they swim up they keep to the same side, approaching and touching the bank as much as they can, for fear doubtless of straying from their course by reason of the stream. When the Nile begins to swell, the hollow places of the land and the depressions by the side of the river first begin to fill, as the water soaks through from the river, and so soon as they become full of water, at once they are all filled with little fishes; and whence these are in all likelihood produced, I think that I perceive. In the preceding year, when the Nile goes down, the fish first lay eggs in the mud and then retire with the last of the retreating waters; and when the time comes round again, and the water once more comes over the land, from these eggs forthwith are produced the fishes of which I speak.

94. Thus it is as regards the fish. And for anointing those of the Egyptians who dwell in the fens use oil from the castor-berry, 80 which oil the Egyptians call kiki, and thus they do:‚Äîthey sow along the banks of the rivers and pools these plants, which in a wild form grow of themselves in the land of the Hellenes; these are sown in Egypt and produce berries in great quantity but of an evil smell; and when they have gathered these, some cut them up and press the oil from them, others again roast them first and then boil them down and collect that which runs away from them. The oil is fat and not less suitable for burning than olive-oil, but it gives forth a disagreeable smell.

95. Against the gnats, which are very abundant, they have contrived as follows:‚Äîthose who dwell above the fen-land are helped by the towers, to which they ascend when they go to rest; for the gnats by reason of the winds are not able to fly up high: but those who dwell in the fen-land have contrived another way instead of the towers, and this is it:‚Äîevery man of them has got a casting net, with which by day he catches fish, but in the night he uses it for this purpose, that is to say he puts the casting-net round about the bed in which he sleeps, and then creeps in under it and goes to sleep: and the gnats, if he sleeps rolled up in a garment or a linen sheet, bite through these, but through the net they do not even attempt to bite.


96. Their boats with which they carry cargoes are made of the thorny acacia, of which the form is very like that of the Kyrenian lotos, and that which exudes from it is gum. From this tree they cut pieces of wood about two cubits in length and arrange them like bricks, fastening the boat together by running a great number of long bolts through the two-cubit pieces; and when they have thus fastened the boat together, they lay cross-pieces 81 over the top, using no ribs for the sides; and within they caulk the seams with papyrus. They make one steering-oar for it, which is passed through the bottom of the boat; and they have a mast of acacia and sails of papyrus. These boats cannot sail up the river unless there be a very fresh wind blowing, but are towed from the shore: down-stream however they travel as follows:‚Äîthey have a door-shaped crate made of tamarisk wood and reed mats sewn together, and also a stone of about two talents weight bored with a hole; and of these the boatman lets the crate float on in front of the boat, fastened with a rope, and the stone drag behind by another rope. The crate then, as the force of the stream presses upon it, goes on swiftly and draws on the baris (for so these boats are called), while the stone dragging after it behind and sunk deep in the water keeps its course straight. These boats they have in great numbers and some of them carry many thousands of talents' burden.

97. When the Nile comes over the land, the cities alone are seen rising above the water, resembling more nearly than anything else the islands in the Egean sea; for the rest of Egypt becomes a sea and the cities alone rise above water. Accordingly, whenever this happens, they pass by water not now by the channels of the river but over the midst of the plain: for example, as one sails up from Naucratis to Memphis the passage is then close by the pyramids, whereas the usual passage is not the same even here, 82 but goes by the point of the Delta and the city of Kercasoros; while if you sail over the plain to Naucratis from the sea and from Canobos, you will go by Anthylla and the city called after Archander.

98. Of these Anthylla is a city of note and is especially assigned to the wife of him who reigns over Egypt, to supply her with sandals, (this is the case since the time when Egypt came to be under the Persians): the other city seems to me to have its name from Archander the son-in-law of Danaos, who was the son of Phthios, the son of Achaios; for it is called the City of Archander. There might indeed be another Archander, but in any case the name is not Egyptian.


99. Hitherto my own observation and judgment and inquiry are the vouchers for that which I have said; but from this point onwards I am about to tell the history of Egypt according to that which I heard, to which will be added also something of that which I have myself seen.

Of Min, who first became king of Egypt, the priests said that on the one hand he banked off the site of Memphis from the river: for the whole stream of the river used to flow along by the sandy mountain-range on the side of Libya, but Min formed by embankments that bend of the river which lies to the South about a hundred furlongs above Memphis, and thus he dried up the old stream and conducted the river so that it flowed in the middle between the mountains: and even now this bend of the Nile is by the Persians kept under very careful watch, that it may flow in the channel to which it is confined, 83 and the bank is repaired every year; for if the river should break through and overflow in this direction, Memphis would be in danger of being overwhelmed by flood. When this Min, who first became king, had made into dry land the part which was dammed off, on the one hand, I say, he founded in it that city which is now called Memphis; for Memphis too is in the narrow part of Egypt;84 and outside the city he dug round it on the North and West a lake communicating with the river, for the side towards the East is barred by the Nile itself. Then secondly he established in the city the temple of Hephaistos a great work and most worthy of mention.

100. After this man the priests enumerated to me from a papyrus roll the names of other kings, three hundred and thirty in number; and in all these generations of men eighteen were Ethiopians, one was a woman, a native Egyptian, and the rest were men and of Egyptian race: and the name of the woman who reigned was the same as that of the Babylonian queen, namely Nitocris. Of her they said that desiring to take vengeance for her brother, whom the Egyptians had slain when he was their king and then, after having slain him, had given his kingdom to her,‚Äîdesiring, I say, to take vengeance for him, she destroyed by craft many of the Egyptians. For she caused to be constructed a very large chamber under ground, and making as though she would handsel it but in her mind devising other things, she invited those of the Egyptians whom she knew to have had most part in the murder, and gave a great banquet. Then while they were feasting, she let in the river upon them by a secret conduit of large size. Of her they told no more than this, except that, when this had been accomplished, she threw herself into a room full of embers, in order that she might escape vengeance.

101. As for the other kings, they could tell me of no great works which had been produced by them, and they said that they had no renown 85 except only the last of them, Moris: he (they said) produced as a memorial of himself the gateway of the temple of Hephaistos which is turned towards the North Wind, and dug a lake, about which I shall set forth afterwards how many furlongs of circuit it has, and in it built pyramids of the size which I shall mention at the same time when I speak of the lake itself. He, they said, produced these works, but of the rest none produced any.

102. Therefore passing these by I shall make mention of the king who came after these, whose name was Sesostris. He (the priests said) first of all set out with ships of war from the Arabian gulf and subdued those who dwelt by the shores of the Erythraian Sea, until as he sailed he came to a sea which could no further be navigated by reason of shoals: then secondly, after he had returned to Egypt, according to the report of the priests he took a great army 86 and marched over the continent, subduing every nation which stood in his way: and those of them whom he found valiant and fighting desperately for their freedom, in their lands he set up pillars which told by inscriptions his own name and the name of his country, and how he had subdued them by his power; but as to those of whose cities he obtained possession without fighting or with ease, on their pillars he inscribed words after the same tenor as he did for the nations which had shown themselves courageous, and in addition he drew upon them the hidden parts of a woman, desiring to signify by this that the people were cowards and effeminate.

103. Thus doing he traversed the continent, until at last he passed over to Europe from Asia and subdued the Scythians and also the Thracians. These, I am of opinion, were the furthest 87 people to which the Egyptian army came, for in their country the pillars are found to have been set up, but in the land beyond this they are no longer found. From this point he turned and began to go back; and when he came to the river Phasis, what happened then I cannot say for certain, whether the king Sesostris himself divided off a certain portion of his army and left the men there as settlers in the land, or whether some of his soldiers were wearied by his distant marches and remained by the river Phasis.



104. For the people of Colchis are evidently Egyptian, and this I perceived for myself before I heard it from others. So when I had come to consider the matter I asked them both; and the Colchians had remembrance of the Egyptians more than the Egyptians of the Colchians; but the Egyptians said they believed that the Colchians were a portion of the army of Sesostris. That this was so I conjectured myself not only because they are dark-skinned and have curly hair (this of itself amounts to nothing, for there are other races which are so), but also still more because the Colchians, Egyptians, and Ethiopians alone of all the races of men have practised circumcision from the first. The Phenicians and the Syrians 88 who dwell in Palestine confess themselves that they have learnt it from the Egyptians, and the Syrians 89 about the river Thermodon and the river Parthenios, and the Macronians, who are their neighbours, say that they have learnt it lately from the Colchians. These are the only races of men who practise circumcision, and these evidently practise it in the same manner as the Egyptians. Of the Egyptians themselves however and the Ethiopians, I am not able to say which learnt from the other, for undoubtedly it is a most ancient custom; but that the other nations learnt it by intercourse with the Egyptians, this among others is to me a strong proof, namely that those of the Phenicians who have intercourse with Hellas cease to follow the example of the Egyptians in this matter, and do not circumcise their children.

105. Now let me tell another thing about the Colchians to show how they resemble the Egyptians:‚Äîthey alone work flax in the same fashion as the Egyptians, 90 and the two nations are like one another in their whole manner of living and also in their language: now the linen of Colchis is called by the Hellenes Sardonic, whereas that from Egypt is called Egyptian.

106. The pillars which Sesostris of Egypt set up in the various countries are for the most part no longer to be seen extant; but in Syria Palestine I myself saw them existing with the inscription upon them which I have mentioned and the emblem. Moreover in Ionia there are two figures of this man carved upon rocks, one on the road by which one goes from the land of Ephesos to Phocaia, and the other on the road from Sardis to Smyrna. In each place there is a figure of a man cut in the rock, of four cubits and a span in height, holding in his right hand a spear and in his left a bow and arrows, and the other equipment which he has is similar to this, for it is both Egyptian and Ethiopian: and from the one shoulder to the other across the breast runs an inscription carved in sacred Egyptian characters, saying thus, ""This land with my shoulders I won for myself."" But who he is and from whence, he does not declare in these places, though in other places he has declared this. Some of those who have seen these carvings conjecture that the figure is that of Memnon, but herein they are very far from the truth.

107. As this Egyptian Sesostris was returning and bringing back many men of the nations whose lands he had subdued, when he came (said the priests) to Daphnai in the district of Pelusion on his journey home, his brother to whom Sesostris had entrusted the charge of Egypt invited him and with him his sons to a feast; and then he piled the house round with brushwood and set it on fire: and Sesostris when he discovered this forthwith took counsel with his wife, for he was bringing with him (they said) his wife also; and she counselled him to lay out upon the pyre two of his sons, which were six in number, and so to make a bridge over the burning mass, and that they passing over their bodies should thus escape. This, they said, Sesostris did, and two of his sons were burnt to death in this manner, but the rest got away safe with their father.

108. Then Sesostris, having returned to Egypt and having taken vengeance on his brother, employed the multitude which he had brought in of those whose lands he had subdued, as follows:‚Äîthese were they who drew the stones which in the reign of this king were brought to the temple of Hephaistos, being of very great size; and also these were compelled to dig all the channels which now are in Egypt; and thus (having no such purpose) they caused Egypt, which before was all fit for riding and driving, to be no longer fit for this from thenceforth: for from that time forward Egypt, though it is plain land, has become all unfit for riding and driving, and the cause has been these channels, which are many and run in all directions. But the reason why the king cut up the land was this, namely because those of the Egyptians who had their cities not on the river but in the middle of the country, being in want of water when the river went down from them, found their drink brackish because they had it from wells.

109. For this reason Egypt was cut up; and they said that this king distributed the land to all the Egyptians, giving an equal square portion to each man, and from this he made his revenue, having appointed them to pay a certain rent every year: and if the river should take away anything from any man's portion, he would come to the king and declare that which had happened, and the king used to send men to examine and to find out by measurement how much less the piece of land had become, in order that for the future the man might pay less, in proportion to the rent appointed: and I think that thus the art of geometry was found out and afterwards came into Hellas also. For as touching the sun-dial 91 and the gnomon 92 and the twelve divisions of the day, they were learnt by the Hellenes from the Babylonians.


110. He moreover alone of all the Egyptian kings had rule over Ethiopia; and he left as memorials of himself in front of the temple of Hephaistos two stone statues of thirty cubits each, representing himself and his wife, and others of twenty cubits each representing his four sons: and long afterwards the priest of Hephaistos refused to permit Dareios the Persian to set up a statue of himself in front of them, saying that deeds had not been done by him equal to those which were done by Sesostris the Egyptian; for Sesostris had subdued other nations besides, not fewer than he, and also the Scythians; but Dareios had not been able to conquer the Scythians: wherefore it was not just that he should set up a statue in front of those which Sesostris had dedicated, if he did not surpass him in his deeds. Which speech, they say, Dareios took in good part.

111. Now after Sesostris had brought his life to an end, his son Pheros, they told me, received in succession the kingdom, and he made no warlike expedition, and moreover it chanced to him to become blind by reason of the following accident:‚Äîwhen the river had come down in flood rising to a height of eighteen cubits, higher than ever before that time, and had gone over the fields, a wind fell upon it and the river became agitated by waves: and this king (they say) moved by presumptuous folly took a spear and cast it into the midst of the eddies of the stream; and immediately upon this he had a disease of the eyes and was by it made blind. For ten years then he was blind, and in the eleventh year there came to him an oracle from the city of Buto saying that the time of his punishment had expired, and that he should see again if he washed his eyes with the water of a woman who had accompanied with her own husband only and had not knowledge of other men: and first he made trial of his own wife, and then, as he continued blind, he went on to try all the women in turn; and when he had at last regained his sight he gathered together all the women of whom he had made trial, excepting her by whose means he had regained his sight, to one city which now is named Erythrabolos, 93 and having gathered them to this he consumed them all by fire, as well as the city itself; but as for her by whose means he had regained his sight, he had her himself to wife. Then after he had escaped the malady of his eyes he dedicated offerings at each one of the temples which were of renown, and especially (to mention only that which is most worthy of mention) he dedicated at the temple of the Sun works which are worth seeing, namely two obelisks of stone, each of a single block, measuring in length a hundred cubits each one and in breadth eight cubits.

112. After him, they said, there succeeded to the throne a man of Memphis, whose name in the tongue of the Hellenes was Proteus; for whom there is now a sacred enclosure at Memphis, very fair and well ordered, lying on that side of the temple of Hephaistos which faces the North Wind. Round about this enclosure dwell Phenicians of Tyre, and this whole region is called the Camp of the Tyrians.94 Within the enclosure of Proteus there is a temple called the temple of the ""foreign Aphrodite,"" which temple I conjecture to be one of Helen the daughter of Tyndareus, not only because I have heard the tale how Helen dwelt with Proteus, but also especially because it is called by the name of the ""foreign Aphrodite,"" for the other temples of Aphrodite which there are have none of them the addition of the word ""foreign"" to the name.

113. And the priests told me, when I inquired, that the things concerning Helen happened thus:‚ÄîAlexander having carried off Helen was sailing away from Sparta to his own land, and when he had come to the Egean Sea contrary winds drove him from his course to the Sea of Egypt; and after that, since the blasts did not cease to blow, he came to Egypt itself, and in Egypt to that which is now named the Canobic mouth of the Nile and to Taricheiai. Now there was upon the shore, as still there is now, a temple of Heracles, in which if any man's slave take refuge and have the sacred marks set upon him, giving himself over to the god, it is not lawful to lay hands upon him; and this custom has continued still unchanged from the beginning down to my own time. Accordingly the attendants of Alexander, having heard of the custom which existed about the temple, ran away from him, and sitting down as suppliants of the god, accused Alexander, because they desired to do him hurt, telling the whole tale how things were about Helen and about the wrong done to Menelaos; and this accusation they made not only to the priests but also to the warden of this river-mouth, whose name was Thonis.

114. Thonis then having heard their tale sent forthwith a message to Proteus at Memphis, which said as follows: ""There hath come a stranger, a Teucrian by race, who hath done in Hellas an unholy deed; for he hath deceived the wife of his own host, and is come hither bringing with him this woman herself and very much wealth, having been carried out of his way by winds to thy land. 95 Shall we then allow him to sail out unharmed, or shall we first take away from him that which he brought with him?"" In reply to this Proteus sent back a messenger who said thus: ""Seize this man, whosoever he may be, who has done impiety to his own host, and bring him away into my presence, that I may know what he will find to say.""

115. Hearing this, Thonis seized Alexander and detained his ships, and after that he brought the man himself up to Memphis and with him Helen and the wealth he had, and also in addition to them the suppliants. So when all had been conveyed up thither, Proteus began to ask Alexander who he was and from whence he was voyaging; and he both recounted to him his descent and told him the name of his native land, and moreover related of his voyage, from whence he was sailing. After this Proteus asked him whence he had taken Helen; and when Alexander went astray in his account and did not speak the truth, those who had become suppliants convicted him of falsehood, relating in full the whole tale of the wrong done. At length Proteus declared to them this sentence, saying, ""Were it not that I count it a matter of great moment not to slay any of those strangers who being driven from their course by winds have come to my land hitherto, I should have taken vengeance on thee on behalf of the man of Hellas, seeing that thou, most base of men, having received from him hospitality, didst work against him a most impious deed. For thou didst go in to the wife of thine own host; and even this was not enough for thee, but thou didst stir her up with desire and hast gone away with her like a thief. Moreover not even this by itself was enough for thee, but thou art come hither with plunder taken from the house of thy host. Now therefore depart, seeing that I have counted it of great moment not to be a slayer of strangers. This woman indeed and the wealth which thou hast I will not allow thee to carry away, but I shall keep them safe for the Hellene who was thy host, until he come himself and desire to carry them off to his home; to thyself however and thy fellow-voyagers I proclaim that ye depart from your anchoring within three days and go from my land to some other; and if not, that ye will be dealt with as enemies.""

116. This the priests said was the manner of Helen's coming to Proteus; and I suppose that Homer also had heard this story, but since it was not so suitable to the composition of his poem as the other which he followed, he dismissed it finally, 96 making it clear at the same time that he was acquainted with that story also: and according to the manner in which he described 97 the wanderings of Alexander in the Iliad (nor did he elsewhere retract that which he had said) it is clear that when he brought Helen he was carried out of his course, wandering to various lands, and that he came among other places to Sidon in Phenicia. Of this the poet has made mention in the ""prowess of Diomede,"" and the verses run this: 98

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""There she had robes many-coloured, the works of women of Sidon,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Those whom her son himself the god-like of form Alexander
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Carried from Sidon, what time the broad sea-path he sailed over
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Bringing back Helene home, of a noble father begotten.""

And in the Odyssey also he has made mention of it in these verses: 99

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Such had the daughter of Zeus, such drugs of exquisite cunning,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Good, which to her the wife of Thon, Polydamna, had given,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Dwelling in Egypt, the land where the bountiful meadow produces
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Drugs more than all lands else, many good being mixed, many evil.""

And thus too Menelaos says to Telemachos: 100

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Still the gods stayed me in Egypt, to come back hither desiring,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Stayed me from voyaging home, since sacrifice was due I performed not.""

In these lines he makes it clear that he knew of the wandering of Alexander to Egypt, for Syria borders upon Egypt and the Phenicians, of whom is Sidon, dwell in Syria.

117. By these lines and by this passage 101 it is also most clearly shown that the ""Cyprian Epic"" was not written by Homer but by some other man: for in this it is said that on the third day after leaving Sparta Alexander came to Ilion bringing with him Helen, having had a ""gently-blowing wind and a smooth sea,"" whereas in the Iliad it says that he wandered from his course when he brought her.

118. Let us now leave Homer and the ""Cyprian"" Epic; but this I will say, namely that I asked the priests whether it is but an idle tale which the Hellenes tell of that which they say happened about Ilion; and they answered me thus, saying that they had their knowledge by inquiries from Menelaos himself. After the rape of Helen there came indeed, they said, to the Teucrian land a large army of Hellenes to help Menelaos; and when the army had come out of the ships to land and had pitched its camp there, they sent messengers to Ilion, with whom went also Menelaos himself; and when these entered within the wall they demanded back Helen and the wealth which Alexander had stolen from Menelaos and had taken away; and moreover they demanded satisfaction for the wrongs done: and the Teucrians told the same tale then and afterwards, both with oath and without oath, namely that in deed and in truth they had not Helen nor the wealth for which demand was made, but that both were in Egypt; and that they could not justly be compelled to give satisfaction for that which Proteus the king of Egypt had. The Hellenes however thought that they were being mocked by them and besieged the city, until at last they took it; and when they had taken the wall and did not find Helen, but heard the same tale as before, then they believed the former tale and sent Menelaos himself to Proteus.

119. And Menelaos having come to Egypt and having sailed up to Memphis, told the truth of these matters, and not only found great entertainment, but also received Helen unhurt, and all his own wealth besides. Then however, after he had been thus dealt with, Menelaos showed himself ungrateful to the Egyptians; for when he set forth to sail away, contrary winds detained him, and as this condition of things lasted long, he devised an impious deed; for he took two children of natives and made sacrifice of them. After this, when it was known that he had done so, he became abhorred, and being pursued he escaped and got away in his ships to Libya; but whither he went besides after this, the Egyptians were not able to tell. Of these things they said that they found out part by inquiries, and the rest, namely that which happened in their own land, they related from sure and certain knowledge.

120. Thus the priests of the Egyptians told me; and I myself also agree with the story which was told of Helen, adding this consideration, namely that if Helen had been in Ilion she would have been given up to the Hellenes, whether Alexander consented or no; for Priam assuredly was not so mad, nor yet the others of his house, that they were desirous to run risk of ruin for themselves and their children and their city, in order that Alexander might have Helen as his wife: and even supposing that during the first part of the time they had been so inclined, yet when many others of the Trojans besides were losing their lives as often as they fought with the Hellenes, and of the sons of Priam himself always two or three or even more were slain when a battle took place (if one may trust at all to the Epic poets),‚Äîwhen, I say, things were coming thus to pass, I consider that even if Priam himself had had Helen as his wife, he would have given her back to the Achaians, if at least by so doing he might be freed from the evils which oppressed him. Nor even was the kingdom coming to Alexander next, so that when Priam was old the government was in his hands; but Hector, who was both older and more of a man than he, would have received it after the death of Priam; and him it behoved not to allow his brother to go on with his wrong-doing, considering that great evils were coming to pass on his account both to himself privately and in general to the other Trojans. In truth however they lacked the power to give Helen back; and the Hellenes did not believe them, though they spoke the truth; because, as I declare my opinion, the divine power was purposing to cause them utterly to perish, and so make it evident to men that for great wrongs great also are the chastisements which come from the gods. And thus have I delivered my opinion concerning these matters.

121. After Proteus, they told me, Rhampsinitos received in succession the kingdom, who left as a memorial of himself that gateway to the temple of Hephaistos which is turned towards the West, and in front of the gateway he set up two statues, in height five-and-twenty cubits, of which the one which stands on the North side is called by the Egyptians Summer and the one on the South side Winter; and to that one which they call Summer they do reverence and make offerings, while to the other which is called Winter they do the opposite of these things. (a) This king, they said, got great wealth of silver, which none of the kings born after him could surpass or even come near to; and wishing to store his wealth in safety he caused to be built a chamber of stone, one of the walls whereof was towards the outside of his palace: and the builder of this, having a design against it, contrived as follows, that is, he disposed one of the stones in such a manner that it could be taken out easily from the wall either by two men or even by one. So when the chamber was finished, the king stored his money in it, and after some time the builder, being near the end of his life, called to him his sons (for he had two) and to them he related how he had contrived in building the treasury of the king, and all in forethought for them, that they might have ample means of living. And when he had clearly set forth to them everything concerning the taking out of the stone, he gave them the measurements, saying that if they paid heed to this matter they would be stewards of the king's treasury. So he ended his life, and his sons made no long delay in setting to work, but went to the palace by night, and having found the stone in the wall of the chamber they dealt with it easily and carried forth for themselves great quantity of the wealth within. (b) And the king happening to open the chamber, he marvelled when he saw the vessels falling short of the full amount, and he did not know on whom he should lay the blame, since the seals were unbroken and the chamber had been close shut; but when upon his opening the chamber a second and a third time the money was each time seen to be diminished, for the thieves did not slacken in their assaults upon it, he did as follows:‚Äîhaving ordered traps to be made he set these round about the vessels in which the money was; and when the thieves had come as at former times and one of them had entered, then so soon as he came near to one of the vessels he was straightway caught in the trap: and when he perceived in what evil case he was, straightway calling his brother he showed him what the matter was, and bade him enter as quickly as possible and cut off his head, for fear lest being seen and known he might bring about the destruction of his brother also. And to the other it seemed that he spoke well, and he was persuaded and did so; and fitting the stone into its place he departed home bearing with him the head of his brother. (c) Now when it became day, the king entered into the chamber and was very greatly amazed, seeing the body of the thief held in the trap without his head, and the chamber unbroken, with no way to come in or go out: and being at a loss he hung up the dead body of the thief upon the wall and set guards there, with charge if they saw any one weeping or bewailing himself to seize him and bring him before the king. And when the dead body had been hung up, the mother was greatly grieved, and speaking with the son who survived she enjoined him, in whatever way he could, to contrive means by which he might take down and bring home the body of his dead brother; and if he should neglect to do this, she earnestly threatened that she would go and give information to the king that he had the money. (d) So as the mother dealt hardly with the surviving son, and he though saying many things to her did not persuade her, he contrived for his purpose a device as follows:‚ÄîProviding himself with asses he filled some skins with wine and laid them upon the asses, and after that he drove them along: and when he came opposite to those who were guarding the corpse hung up, he drew towards him two or three of the necks 102 of the skins and loosened the cords with which they were tied. Then when the wine was running out, he began to beat his head and cry out loudly, as if he did not know to which of the asses he should first turn; and when the guards saw the wine flowing out in streams, they ran together to the road with drinking vessels in their hands and collected the wine that was poured out, counting it so much gain; and he abused them all violently, making as if he were angry, but when the guards tried to appease him, after a time he feigned to be pacified and to abate his anger, and at length he drove his asses out of the road and began to set their loads right. Then more talk arose among them, and one or two of them made jests at him and brought him to laugh with them; and in the end he made them a present of one of the skins in addition to what they had. Upon that they lay down there without more ado, being minded to drink, and they took him into their company and invited him to remain with them and join them in their drinking: so he (as may be supposed) was persuaded and stayed. Then as they in their drinking bade him welcome in a friendly manner, he made a present to them also of another of the skins; and so at length having drunk liberally the guards became completely intoxicated; and being overcome by sleep they went to bed on the spot where they had been drinking. He then, as it was now far on in the night, first took down the body of his brother, and then in mockery shaved the right cheeks of all the guards; and after that he put the dead body upon the asses and drove them away home, having accomplished that which was enjoined him by his mother. (e) Upon this the king, when it was reported to him that the dead body of the thief had been stolen away, displayed great anger; and desiring by all means that it should be found out who it might be who devised these things, did this (so at least they said, but I do not believe the account),‚Äîhe caused his own daughter to sit in the stews, and enjoined her to receive all equally, and before having commerce with any one to compel him to tell her what was the most cunning and what the most unholy deed which had been done by him in all his life-time; and whosoever should relate that which had happened about the thief, him she must seize and not let him go out. Then as she was doing that which was enjoined by her father, the thief, hearing for what purpose this was done and having a desire to get the better of the king in resource, did thus:‚Äîfrom the body of one lately dead he cut off the arm at the shoulder and went with it under his mantle: and having gone in to the daughter of the king, and being asked that which the others also were asked, he related that he had done the most unholy deed when he cut off the head of his brother, who had been caught in a trap in the king's treasure-chamber, and the most cunning deed in that he made drunk the guards and took down the dead body of his brother hanging up; and she when she heard it tried to take hold of him, but the thief held out to her in the darkness the arm of the corpse, which she grasped and held, thinking that she was holding the arm of the man himself; but the thief left it in her hands and departed, escaping through the door. (f) Now when this also was reported to the king, he was at first amazed at the ready invention and daring of the fellow, and then afterwards he sent round to all the cities and made proclamation granting a free pardon to the thief, and also promising a great reward if he would come into his presence. The thief accordingly trusting to the proclamation came to the king, and Rhampsinitos greatly marvelled at him, and gave him this daughter of his to wife, counting him to be the most knowing of all men; for as the Egyptians were distinguished from all other men, so was he from the other Egyptians.

122. After these things they said this king went down alive to that place which by the Hellenes is called Hades, and there played at dice with Demeter, and in some throws he overcame her and in others he was overcome by her; and he came back again having as a gift from her a handkerchief of gold: and they told me that because of the going down of Rhampsinitos the Egyptians after he came back celebrated a feast, which I know of my own knowledge also that they still observe even to my time; but whether it is for this cause that they keep the feast or for some other, I am not able to say. However, the priests weave a robe completely on the very day of the feast, and forthwith they bind up the eyes of one of them with a fillet, and having led him with the robe to the way by which one goes to the temple of Demeter, they depart back again themselves. This priest, they say, with his eyes bound up is led by two wolves to the temple of Demeter, which is distant from the city twenty furlongs, and then afterwards the wolves lead him back again from the temple to the same spot.

123. Now as to the tales told by the Egyptians, any man may accept them to whom such things appear credible; as for me, it is to be understood throughout the whole of the history 103 that I write by hearsay that which is reported by the people in each place. The Egyptians say that Demeter and Dionysos are rulers of the world below; and the Egyptians are also the first who reported the doctrine that the soul of man is immortal, and that when the body dies, the soul enters into another creature which chances then to be coming to the birth, and when it has gone the round of all the creatures of land and sea and of the air, it enters again into a human body as it comes to the birth; and that it makes this round in a period of three thousand years. This doctrine certain Hellenes adopted, some earlier and some later, as if it were of their own invention, and of these men I know the names but I abstain from recording them.

124. Down to the time when Rhampsinitos was king, they told me there was in Egypt nothing but orderly rule, and Egypt prospered greatly; but after him Cheops became king over them and brought them 104 to every kind of evil: for he shut up all the temples, and having first kept them from sacrificing there, he then bade all the Egyptians work for him. So some were appointed to draw stones from the stone-quarries in the Arabian mountains to the Nile, and others he ordered to receive the stones after they had been carried over the river in boats, and to draw them to those which are called the Libyan mountains; and they worked by a hundred thousand men at a time, for each three months continually. Of this oppression there passed ten years while the causeway was made by which they drew the stones, which causeway they built, and it is a work not much less, as it appears to me, than the pyramid; for the length of it is five furlongs 105 and the breadth ten fathoms and the height, where it is highest, eight fathoms, and it is made of stone smoothed and with figures carved upon it. For this, they said, the ten years were spent, and for the underground chambers on the hill upon which the pyramids stand, which he caused to be made as sepulchral chambers for himself in an island, having conducted thither a channel from the Nile. For the making of the pyramid itself there passed a period of twenty years; and the pyramid is square, each side measuring eight hundred feet, and the height of it is the same. It is built of stone smoothed and fitted together in the most perfect manner, not one of the stones being less than thirty feet in length.

125. This pyramid was made after the manner of steps, which some call ""rows"" 106 and others ""bases"": 107 and when they had first made it thus, they raised the remaining stones with machines made of short pieces of timber, raising them first from the ground to the first stage of the steps, and when the stone got up to this it was placed upon another machine standing on the first stage, and so from this it was drawn to the second upon another machine; for as many as were the courses of the steps, so many machines there were also, or perhaps they transferred one and the same machine, made so as easily to be carried, to each stage successively, in order that they might take up the stones; for let it be told in both ways, according as it is reported. However that may be, the highest parts of it were finished first, and afterwards they proceeded to finish that which came next to them, and lastly they finished the parts of it near the ground and the lowest ranges. On the pyramid it is declared in Egyptian writing how much was spent on radishes and onions and leeks for the workmen, and if I rightly remember that which the interpreter said in reading to me this inscription, a sum of one thousand six hundred talents of silver was spent; and if this is so, how much besides is likely to have been expended upon the iron with which they worked, and upon bread and clothing for the workmen, seeing that they were building the works for the time which has been mentioned and were occupied for no small time besides, as I suppose, in the cutting and bringing of the stones and in working at the excavation under the ground?

126. Cheops moreover came, they said, to such a pitch of wickedness, that being in want of money he caused his own daughter to sit in the stews, and ordered her to obtain from those who came a certain amount of money (how much it was they did not tell me); but she not only obtained the sum appointed by her father, but also she formed a design for herself privately to leave behind her a memorial, and she requested each man who came in to her to give her one stone upon her building: and of these stones, they told me, the pyramid was built which stands in front of the great pyramid in the middle of the three, 108 each side being one hundred and fifty feet in length.

127. This Cheops, the Egyptians said, reigned fifty years; and after he was dead his brother Chephren succeeded to the kingdom. This king followed the same manner as the other, both in all the rest and also in that he made a pyramid, not indeed attaining to the measurements of that which was built by the former (this I know, having myself also measured it), and moreover 109 there are no underground chambers beneath nor does a channel come from the Nile flowing to this one as to the other, in which the water coming through a conduit built for it flows round an island within, where they say that Cheops himself is laid: but for a basement he built the first course of Ethiopian stone of divers colours; and this pyramid he made forty feet lower than the other as regards size, 110 building it close to the great pyramid. These stand both upon the same hill, which is about a hundred feet high. And Chephren they said reigned fifty and six years.

128. Here then they reckon one hundred and six years, during which they say that there was nothing but evil for the Egyptians, and the temples were kept closed and not opened during all that time. These kings the Egyptians by reason of their hatred of them are not very willing to name; nay, they even call the pyramids after the name of Philitis 111 the shepherd, who at that time pastured flocks in those regions.

129. After him, they said, Mykerinos became king over Egypt, who was the son of Cheops; and to him his father's deeds were displeasing, and he both opened the temples and gave liberty to the people, who were ground down to the last extremity of evil, to return to their own business and to their sacrifices;: also he gave decisions of their causes juster than those of all the other kings besides. In regard to this then they commend this king more than all the other kings who had arisen in Egypt before him; for he not only gave good decisions, but also when a man complained of the decision, he gave him recompense from his own goods and thus satisfied his desire. But while Mykerinos was acting mercifully to his subjects and practising this conduct which has been said, calamities befell him, of which the first was this, namely that his daughter died, the only child whom he had in his house: and being above measure grieved by that which had befallen him, and desiring to bury his daughter in a manner more remarkable than others, he made a cow of wood, which he covered over with gold, and then within it he buried this daughter who, as I said, had died.

130. This cow was not covered up in the ground, but it might be seen even down to my own time in the city of Sa√Øs, placed within the royal palace in a chamber which was greatly adorned; and they offer incense of all kinds before it every day, and each night a lamp burns beside it all through the night. Near this cow in another chamber stand images of the concubines of Mykerinos, as the priests at Sa√Øs told me; for there are in fact colossal wooden statues, in number about twenty, made with naked bodies; but who they are I am not able to say, except only that which is reported.

131. Some however tell about this cow and the colossal statues the following tale, namely that Mykerinos was enamoured of his own daughter and afterwards ravished her; and upon this they say that the girl strangled herself for grief, and he buried her in this cow; and her mother cut off the hands of the maids who had betrayed the daughter to her father; wherefore now the images of them have suffered that which the maids suffered in their life. In thus saying they speak idly, as it seems to me, especially in what they say about the hands of the statues; for as to this, even we ourselves saw that their hands had dropped off from lapse of time, and they were to be seen still lying at their feet even down to my time.

132. The cow is covered up with a crimson robe, except only the head and the neck, which are seen, overlaid with gold very thickly; and between the horns there is the disc of the sun figured in gold. The cow is not standing up but kneeling, and in size it is equal to a large living cow. Every year it is carried forth from the chamber, at those times, I say, the Egyptians beat themselves for that god whom I will not name upon occasion of such a matter; at these times, I say, they also carry forth the cow to the light of day, for they say that she asked of her father Mykerinos, when she was dying, that she might look upon the sun once in the year.

133. After the misfortune of his daughter it happened, they said, secondly to this king as follows:‚ÄîAn oracle came to him from the city of Buto, saying that he was destined to live but six years more, in the seventh year to end his life: and he being indignant at it sent to the Oracle a reproach against the god, 112 making complaint in reply that whereas his father and uncle, who had shut up the temples and had not only not remembered the gods, but also had been destroyers of men, had lived for a long time, he himself, who practised piety, was destined to end his life so soon: and from the Oracle there came a second message, which said that it was for this very cause that he was bringing his life to a swift close; 113 for he had not done that which it was appointed for him to do, since it was destined that Egypt should suffer evils for a hundred and fifty years, and the two kings who had risen before him had perceived this, but he had not. Mykerinos having heard this, and considering that this sentence had been passed upon him beyond recall, procured many lamps, and whenever night came on he lighted these and began to drink and take his pleasure, ceasing neither by day nor by night; and he went about to the fen-country and to the woods and wherever he heard there were the most suitable places for enjoyment. This he devised (having a mind to prove that the Oracle spoke falsely) in order that he might have twelve years of life instead of six, the nights being turned into days.

134. This king also left behind him a pyramid, much smaller than that of his father, of a square shape and measuring on each side three hundred feet lacking twenty, built moreover of Ethiopian stone up to half the height. This pyramid some of the Hellenes say was built by the courtesan Rhodopis, not therein speaking rightly: and besides this it is evident to me that they who speak thus do not even know who Rhodopis was, for otherwise they would not have attributed to her the building of a pyramid like this, on which have been spent (so to speak) innumerable thousands of talents: moreover they do not know that Rhodopis flourished in the reign of Amasis, and not in this king's reign; for Rhodopis lived very many years later than the kings who left behind the pyramids. By descent she was of Thrace, and she was a slave of Iadmon the son of Hephaistopolis a Samian, and a fellow-slave of Esop the maker of fables; for he too was once the slave of Iadmon, as was proved especially in this fact, namely that when the people of Delphi repeatedly made proclamation in accordance with an oracle, to find some one who would take up 114 the blood-money for the death of Esop, no one else appeared, but at length the grandson of Iadmon, called Iadmon also, took it up; and thus it is shown that Esop too was the slave of Iadmon.

135. As for Rhodopis, she came to Egypt brought by Xanthes the Samian, and having come thither to exercise her calling she was redeemed from slavery for a great sum by a man of Mytilene, Charaxos son of Scamandronymos and brother of Sappho the lyric poet. Thus was Rhodopis set free, and she remained in Egypt and by her beauty won so much liking that she made great gain of money for one like Rhodopis, 115 though not enough to suffice for the cost of such a pyramid as this. In truth there is no need to ascribe to her very great riches, considering that the tithe of her wealth may still be seen even to this time by any one who desires it: for Rhodopis wished to leave behind her a memorial of herself in Hellas, namely to cause a thing to be made such as happens not to have been thought of or dedicated in a temple by any besides, and to dedicate this at Delphi as a memorial of herself. Accordingly with the tithe of her wealth she caused to be made spits of iron of size large enough to pierce a whole ox, and many in number, going as far therein as her tithe allowed her, and she sent them to Delphi: these are even at the present time lying there, heaped all together behind the altar which the Chians dedicated, and just opposite to the cell of the temple. 116 Now at Naucratis, as it happens, the courtesans are rather apt to win credit; 117 for this woman first, about whom the story to which I refer is told, became so famous that all the Hellenes without exception come to know the name of Rhodopis, and then after her one whose name was Archidiche became a subject of song over all Hellas, though she was less talked of than the other. As for Charaxos, when after redeeming Rhodopis he returned back to Mytilene, Sappho in an ode violently abused him. 118 Of Rhodopis then I shall say no more.

136. After Mykerinos the priests said Asychis became king of Egypt, and he made for Hephaistos the temple gateway 119 which is towards the sunrising, by far the most beautiful and the largest of the gateways; for while they all have figures carved upon them and innumerable ornaments of building 120 besides, this has them very much more than the rest. In this king's reign they told me that, as the circulation of money was very slow, a law was made for the Egyptians that a man might have that money lent to him which he needed, by offering as security the dead body of his father; and there was added moreover to this law another, namely that he who lent the money should have a claim also to the whole sepulchral chamber belonging to him who received it, and that the man who offered that security should be subject to this penalty, if he refused to pay back the debt, namely that neither the man himself should be allowed to have burial when he died, either in that family burial-place or in any other, nor should he be allowed to bury any one of his kinsmen whom he lost by death. This king desiring to surpass the kings of Egypt who had arisen before him left as a memorial of himself a pyramid which he made of bricks, and on it there is an inscription carved in stone and saying thus: ""Despise not me in comparison with the pyramids of stone, seeing that I excel them as much as Zeus excels the other gods; for with a pole they struck into the lake, and whatever of the mud attached itself to the pole, this they gathered up and made bricks, and in such manner they finished me.""

Such were the deeds which this king performed;

137, and after him reigned a blind man of the city of Anysis, whose name was Anysis. In his reign the Ethiopians and Sabacos the king of the Ethiopians marched upon Egypt with a great host of men; so this blind man departed, flying to the fen-country, and the Ethiopian was king over Egypt for fifty years, during which he performed deeds as follows:‚Äîwhenever any man of the Egyptians committed any transgression, he would never put him to death, but he gave sentence upon each man according to the greatness of the wrong-doing, appointing them work at throwing up an embankment before that city from whence each man came of those who committed wrong. Thus the cities were made higher still than before; for they were embanked first by those who dug the channels in the reign of Sesostris, and then secondly in the reign of the Ethiopian, and thus they were made very high: and while other cities in Egypt also stood 121 high, I think in the town at Bubastis especially the earth was piled up. In this city there is a temple very well worthy of mention, for though there are other temples which are larger and built with more cost, none more than this is a pleasure to the eyes. Now Bubastis in the Hellenic tongue is Artemis,

138, and her temple is ordered thus:‚ÄîExcept the entrance it is completely surrounded by water; for channels come in from the Nile, not joining one another, but each extending as far as the entrance of the temple, one flowing round on the one side and the other on the other side, each a hundred feet broad and shaded over with trees; and the gateway has a height of ten fathoms, and it is adorned with figures six cubits high, very noteworthy. This temple is in the middle of the city and is looked down upon from all sides as one goes round, for since the city has been banked up to a height, while the temple has not been moved from the place where it was at the first built, it is possible to look down into it: and round it runs a stone wall with figures carved upon it, while within it there is a grove of very large trees planted round a large temple-house, within which is the image of the goddess: and the breadth and length of the temple is a furlong every way. Opposite the entrance there is a road paved with stone for about three furlongs, which leads through the market-place towards the East, with a breadth of about four hundred feet; and on this side and on that grow trees of height reaching to heaven: and the road leads to the temple of Hermes. This temple then is thus ordered.

139. The final deliverance from the Ethiopian came about (they said) as follows:‚Äîhe fled away because he had seen in his sleep a vision, in which it seemed to him that a man came and stood by him and counselled him to gather together all the priests of Egypt and cut them asunder in the midst. Having seen this dream, he said that it seemed to him that the gods were foreshowing him this to furnish an occasion against him, 122 in order that he might do an impious deed with respect to religion, and so receive some evil either from the gods or from men: he would not however do so, but in truth (he said) the time had expired, during which it had been prophesied to him that he should rule Egypt before he departed thence. For when he was in Ethiopia the Oracles which the Ethiopians consult had told him that it was fated for him to rule Egypt fifty years: since then this time was now expiring, and the vision of the dream also disturbed him, Sabacos departed out of Egypt of his own free will.

140. Then when the Ethiopian had gone away out of Egypt, the blind man came back from the fen-country and began to rule again, having lived there during fifty years upon an island which he had made by heaping up ashes and earth: for whenever any of the Egyptians visited him bringing food, according as it had been appointed to them severally to do without the knowledge of the Ethiopian, he bade them bring also some ashes for their gift. 123 This island none was able to find before Amyrtaios; that is, for more than seven hundred years 124 the kings who arose before Amyrtaios were not able to find it. Now the name of this island is Elbo, and its size is ten furlongs each way.

141. After him there came to the throne the priest of Hephaistos, whose name was Sethos. This man, they said, neglected and held in no regard the warrior class of the Egyptians, considering that he would have no need of them; and besides other slights which he put upon them, he also took from them the yokes of corn-land 125 which had been given to them as a special gift in the reigns of the former kings, twelve yokes to each man. After this, Sanacharib king of the Arabians and of the Assyrians marched a great host against Egypt. Then the warriors of the Egyptians refused to come to the rescue, and the priest, being driven into a strait, entered into the sanctuary of the temple 126 and bewailed to the image of the god the danger which was impending over him; and as he was thus lamenting, sleep came upon him, and it seemed to him in his vision that the god came and stood by him and encouraged him, saying that he should suffer no evil if he went forth to meet the army of the Arabians; for he himself would send him helpers. Trusting in these things seen in sleep, he took with him, they said, those of the Egyptians who were willing to follow him, and encamped in Pelusion, for by this way the invasion came: and not one of the warrior class followed him, but shop-keepers and artisans and men of the market. Then after they came, there swarmed by night upon their enemies mice of the fields, and ate up their quivers and their bows, and moreover the handles of their shields, so that on the next day they fled, and being without defence of arms great numbers fell. And at the present time this king stands in the temple of Hephaistos in stone, holding upon his hand a mouse, and by letters inscribed he says these words: ""Let him who looks upon me learn to fear the gods.""

142. So far in the story the Egyptians and the priests were they who made the report, declaring that from the first king down to this priest of Hephaistos who reigned last, there had been three hundred and forty-one generations of men, and that in them there had been the same number of chief-priests and of kings: but three hundred generations of men are equal to ten thousand years, for a hundred years is three generations of men; and in the one-and-forty generations which remain, those I mean which were added to the three hundred, there are one thousand three hundred and forty years. Thus in the period of eleven thousand three hundred and forty years they said that there had arisen no god in human form; nor even before that time or afterwards among the remaining kings who arose in Egypt, did they report that anything of that kind had come to pass. In this time they said that the sun had moved four times from his accustomed place of rising, and where he now sets he had thence twice had his rising, and in the place from whence he now rises he had twice had his setting; 127 and in the meantime nothing in Egypt had been changed from its usual state, neither that which comes from the earth nor that which comes to them from the river nor that which concerns diseases or deaths.

143. And formerly when Hecataios the historian was in Thebes, and had traced his descent and connected his family with a god in the sixteenth generation before, the priests of Zeus did for him much the same as they did for me (though I had not traced my descent). They led me into the sanctuary of the temple, which is of great size, and they counted up the number, showing colossal wooden statues in number the same as they said; for each chief-priest there sets up in his lifetime an image of himself: accordingly the priests, counting and showing me these, declared to me that each one of them was a son succeeding his own father, and they went up through the series of images from the image of the one who had died last, until they had declared this of the whole number. And when Hecataios had traced his descent and connected his family with a god in the sixteenth generation, they traced a descent in opposition to this, besides their numbering, not accepting it from him that a man had been born from a god; and they traced their counter-descent thus, saying that each one of the statues had been piromis son of piromis, until they had declared this of the whole three hundred and forty-five statues, each one being surnamed piromis; and neither with a god nor a hero did they connect their descent. Now piromis means in the tongue of Hellas ""honourable and good man.""

144. From their declaration then it followed, that they of whom the images were had been of form like this, and far removed from being gods: but in the time before these men they said that gods were the rulers in Egypt, not mingling 128 with men, and that of these always one had power at a time; and the last of them who was king over Egypt was Oros the son of Osiris, whom the Hellenes call Apollo: he was king over Egypt last, having deposed Typhon. Now Osiris in the tongue of Hellas is Dionysos.

145. Among the Hellenes Heracles and Dionysos and Pan are accounted the latest-born of the gods; but with the Egyptians Pan is a very ancient god, and he is one of those which are called the eight gods, while Heracles is of the second rank, who are called the twelve gods, and Dionysos is of the third rank, namely of those who were born of the twelve gods. Now as to Heracles I have shown already how many years old he is according to the Egyptians themselves, reckoning down to the reign of Amasis, and Pan is said to have existed for yet more years than these, and Dionysos for the smallest number of years as compared with the others; and even for this last they reckon down to the reign of Amasis fifteen thousand years. This the Egyptians say that they know for a certainty, since they always kept a reckoning and wrote down the years as they came. Now the Dionysos who is said to have been born of Semele the daughter of Cadmos, was born about sixteen hundred years before my time, and Heracles who was the son of Alcmene, about nine hundred years, and that Pan who was born of Penelope, for of her and of Hermes Pan is said by the Hellenes to have been born, came into being later than the wars of Troy, about eight hundred years before my time.

146. Of these two accounts every man may adopt that one which he shall find the more credible when he hears it. I however, for my part, have already declared my opinion about them. 129 For if these also, like Heracles the son of Amphitryon, had appeared before all men's eyes and had lived their lives to old age in Hellas, I mean Dionysos the son of Semele and Pan the son of Penelope, then one would have said that these also 130 had been born mere men, having the names of those gods who had come into being long before: but as it is, with regard to Dionysos the Hellenes say that as soon as he was born Zeus sewed him up in his thigh and carried him to Nysa, which is above Egypt in the land of Ethiopia; and as to Pan, they cannot say whither he went after he was born. Hence it has become clear to me that the Hellenes learnt the names of these gods later than those of the other gods, and trace their descent as if their birth occurred at the time when they first learnt their names.

Thus far then the history is told by the Egyptians themselves;
147, but I will now recount that which other nations also tell, and the Egyptians in agreement with the others, of that which happened in this land: and there will be added to this also something of that which I have myself seen.

Being set free after the reign of the priest of Hephaistos, the Egyptians, since they could not live any time without a king, set up over them twelve kings, having divided all Egypt into twelve parts. These made intermarriages with one another and reigned, making agreement that they would not put down one another by force, nor seek to get an advantage over one another, but would live in perfect friendship: and the reason why they made these agreements, guarding them very strongly from violation, was this, namely that an oracle had been given to them at first when they began to exercise their rule, that he of them who should pour a libation with a bronze cup in the temple of Hephaistos, should be king of all Egypt (for they used to assemble together in all the temples).

148. Moreover they resolved to join all together and leave a memorial of themselves; and having so resolved they caused to be made a labyrinth, situated a little above the lake of Moiris and nearly opposite to that which is called the City of Crocodiles. This I saw myself, and I found it greater than words can say. For if one should put together and reckon up all the buildings and all the great works produced by the Hellenes, they would prove to be inferior in labour and expense to this labyrinth, though it is true that both the temple at Ephesos and that at Samos are works worthy of note. The pyramids also were greater than words can say, and each one of them is equal to many works of the Hellenes, great as they may be; but the labyrinth surpasses even the pyramids. It has twelve courts covered in, with gates facing one another, six upon the North side and six upon the South, joining on one to another, and the same wall surrounds them all outside; and there are in it two kinds of chambers, the one kind below the ground and the other above upon these, three thousand in number, of each kind fifteen hundred. The upper set of chambers we ourselves saw, going through them, and we tell of them having looked upon them with our own eyes; but the chambers under ground we heard about only; for the Egyptians who had charge of them were not willing on any account to show them, saying that here were the sepulchres of the kings who had first built this labyrinth and of the sacred crocodiles. Accordingly we speak of the chambers below by what we received from hearsay, while those above we saw ourselves and found them to be works of more than human greatness. For the passages through the chambers, and the goings this way and that way through the courts, which were admirably adorned, afforded endless matter for marvel, as we went through from a court to the chambers beyond it, and from the chambers to colonnades, and from the colonnades to other rooms, and then from the chambers again to other courts. Over the whole of these is a roof made of stone like the walls; and the walls are covered with figures carved upon them, each court being surrounded with pillars of white stone fitted together most perfectly; and at the end of the labyrinth, by the corner of it, there is a pyramid of forty fathoms, upon which large figures are carved, and to this there is a way made under ground.

149. Such is this labyrinth; but a cause for marvel even greater than this is afforded by the lake, which is called the lake of Moiris, along the side of which this labyrinth is built. The measure of its circuit is three thousand six hundred furlongs 131 (being sixty schoines), and this is the same number of furlongs as the extent of Egypt itself along the sea. The lake lies extended lengthwise from North to South, and in depth where it is deepest it is fifty fathoms. That this lake is artificial and formed by digging is self-evident, for about in the middle of the lake stand two pyramids, each rising above the water to a height of fifty fathoms, the part which is built below the water being of just the same height; and upon each is placed a colossal statue of stone sitting upon a chair. Thus the pyramids are a hundred fathoms high; and these hundred fathoms are equal to a furlong of six hundred feet, the fathom being measured as six feet or four cubits, the feet being four palms each, and the cubits six. The water in the lake does not come from the place where it is, for the country there is very deficient in water, but it has been brought thither from the Nile by a canal: and for six months the water flows into the lake, and for six months out into the Nile again; and whenever it flows out, then for the six months it brings into the royal treasury a talent of silver a day from the fish which are caught, and twenty pounds 132 when the water comes in.

150. The natives of the place moreover said that this lake had an outlet under ground to the Syrtis which is in Libya, turning towards the interior of the continent upon the Western side and running along by the mountain which is above Memphis. Now since I did not see anywhere existing the earth dug out of this excavation (for that was a matter which drew my attention), I asked those who dwelt nearest to the lake where the earth was which had been dug out. These told me to what place it had been carried away; and I readily believed them, for I knew by report that a similar thing had been done at Nineveh, the city of the Assyrians. There certain thieves formed a design once to carry away the wealth of Sardanapallos son of Ninos, the king, which wealth was very great and was kept in treasure-houses under the earth. Accordingly they began from their own dwelling, and making estimate of their direction they dug under ground towards the king's palace; and the earth which was brought out of the excavation they used to carry away, when night came on, to the river Tigris which flows by the city of Nineveh, until at last they accomplished that which they desired. Similarly, as I heard, the digging of the lake in Egypt was effected, except that it was done not by night but during the day; for as they dug the Egyptians carried to the Nile the earth which was dug out; and the river, when it received it, would naturally bear it away and disperse it. Thus is this lake said to have been dug out.

151. Now the twelve kings continued to rule justly, but in course of time it happened thus:‚ÄîAfter sacrifice in the temple of Hephaistos they were about to make libation on the last day of the feast, and the chief-priest, in bringing out for them the golden cups with which they had been wont to pour libations, missed his reckoning and brought eleven only for the twelve kings. Then that one of them who was standing last in order, namely Psammetichos, since he had no cup took off from his head his helmet, which was of bronze, and having held it out to receive the wine he proceeded to make libation: likewise all the other kings were wont to wear helmets and they happened to have them then. Now Psammetichos held out his helmet with no treacherous meaning; but they taking note of that which had been done by Psammetichos and of the oracle, namely how it had been declared to them that whosoever of them should make libation with a bronze cup should be sole king of Egypt, recollecting, I say, the saying of the Oracle, they did not indeed deem it right to slay Psammetichos, since they found by examination that he had not done it with any forethought, but they determined to strip him of almost all his power and to drive him away into the fen-country, and that from the fen-country he should not hold any dealings with the rest of Egypt.

152. This Psammetichos had formerly been a fugitive from the Ethiopian Sabacos who had killed his father Necos, from him, I say, he had then been a fugitive in Syria; and when the Ethiopian had departed in consequence of the vision of the dream, the Egyptians who were of the district of Sa√Øs brought him back to his own country. Then afterwards, when he was king, it was his fate to be a fugitive a second time on account of the helmet, being driven by the eleven kings into the fen-country. So then holding that he had been grievously wronged by them, he thought how he might take vengeance on those who had driven him out: and when he had sent to the Oracle of Leto in the city of Buto, where the Egyptians have their most truthful Oracle, there was given to him the reply that vengeance would come when men of bronze appeared from the sea. And he was strongly disposed not to believe that bronze men would come to help him; but after no long time had passed, certain Ionians and Carians who had sailed forth for plunder were compelled to come to shore in Egypt, and they having landed and being clad in bronze armour, one of the Egyptians, not having before seen men clad in bronze armour, came to the fen-land and brought a report to Psammetichos that bronze men had come from the sea and were plundering the plain. So he, perceiving that the saying of the Oracle was coming to pass, dealt in a friendly manner with the Ionians and Carians, and with large promises he persuaded them to take his part. Then when he had persuaded them, with the help of those Egyptians who favoured his cause and of these foreign mercenaries he overthrew the kings.

153. Having thus got power over all Egypt, Psammetichos made for Hephaistos that gateway of the temple at Memphis which is turned towards the South Wind; and he built a court for Apis, in which Apis is kept when he appears, opposite to the gateway of the temple, surrounded all with pillars and covered with figures; and instead of columns there stand to support the roof of the court colossal statues twelve cubits high. Now Apis is in the tongue of the Hellenes Epaphos.

154. To the Ionians and to the Carians who had helped him Psammetichos granted portions of land to dwell in, opposite to one another with the river Nile between, and these were called ""Encampments"": 133 these portions of land he gave them, and he paid them besides all that he had promised: moreover he placed with them Egyptian boys to have them taught the Hellenic tongue; and from these, who learnt the language thoroughly, are descended the present class of interpreters in Egypt. Now the Ionians and Carians occupied these portions of land for a long time, and they are towards the sea a little below the city of Bubastis, on that which is called the Pelusian mouth of the Nile. These men king Amasis afterwards removed from thence and established them at Memphis, making them into a guard for himself against the Egyptians: and they being settled in Egypt, we who are Hellenes know by intercourse with them the certainty of all that which happened in Egypt beginning from king Psammetichos and afterwards; for these were the first men of foreign tongue who settled in Egypt: and in the land from which they were removed there still remained down to my time the sheds where their ships were drawn up and the ruins of their houses.

Thus then Psammetichos obtained Egypt:

155, and of the Oracle which is in Egypt I have made mention often before this, and now I will give an account of it, seeing that it is worthy to be described. This Oracle which is in Egypt is sacred to Leto, and it is established in a great city near that mouth of the Nile which is called Sebennytic, as one sails up the river from the sea; and the name of this city where the Oracle is found is Buto, as I have said before in mentioning it. In this Buto there is a temple of Apollo and Artemis; and the temple-house 134 of Leto, in which the Oracle is, is both great in itself and has a gateway of the height of ten fathoms: but that which caused me most to marvel of the things to be seen there, I will now tell. There is in this sacred enclosure a house of Leto made of one single stone as regards both height and length, and of which all the walls are in these two directions equal, each being forty cubits; and for the covering in of the roof there lies another stone upon the top, the cornice measuring four cubits. 135

156. This house then of all the things that were to be seen by me in that temple is the most marvellous, and among those which come next is the island called Chemmis. This is situated in a deep and broad lake by the side of the temple at Buto, and it is said by the Egyptians that this island is a floating island. I myself did not see it either floating about or moved from its place, and I feel surprise at hearing of it, wondering if it be indeed a floating island. In this island of which I speak there is a great temple-house of Apollo, and three several altars are set up within, and there are planted in the island many palm-trees and other trees, both bearing fruit and not bearing fruit. And the Egyptians, when they say that it is floating, add this story, namely that in this island, which formerly was not floating, Leto, being one of the eight gods who came into existence first, and dwelling in the city of Buto where she has this Oracle, received Apollo from Isis as a charge and preserved him, concealing him in the island which is said now to be a floating island, at that time when Typhon came after him seeking everywhere and desiring to find the son of Osiris. Now they say that Apollo and Artemis are children of Dionysos and of Isis, and that Leto became their nurse and preserver; and in the Egyptian tongue Apollo is Oros, Demeter is Isis, and Artemis is Bubastis. From this story and from no other √Üschylus the son of Euphorion took 136 this which I shall say, wherein he differs from all the preceding poets; he represented namely that Artemis was the daughter of Demeter. For this reason then, they say, it became a floating island.

Such is the story which they tell;

157, but as for Psammetichos, he was king over Egypt for four-and-fifty years, of which for thirty years save one he was sitting before Azotos, a great city of Syria, besieging it, until at last he took it: and this Azotos of all cities about which we have knowledge held out for the longest time under a siege.

158. The son of Psammetichos was Necos, and he became king of Egypt. This man was the first who attempted the channel leading to the Erythraian Sea, which Dareios the Persian afterwards completed: the length of this is a voyage of four days, and in breadth it was so dug that two triremes could go side by side driven by oars; and the water is brought into it from the Nile. The channel is conducted a little above the city of Bubastis by Patumos the Arabian city, and runs into the Erythraian Sea: and it is dug first along those parts of the plain of Egypt which lie towards Arabia, just above which run the mountains which extend opposite Memphis, where are the stone-quarries,‚Äîalong the base of these mountains the channel is conducted from West to East for a great way; and after that it is directed towards a break in the hills and tends from these mountains towards the noon-day and the South Wind to the Arabian gulf. Now in the place where the journey is least and shortest from the Northern to the Southern Sea (which is also called Erythraian), that is from Mount Casion, which is the boundary between Egypt and Syria, the distance is exactly 137 a thousand furlongs to the Arabian gulf; but the channel is much longer, since it is more winding; and in the reign of Necos there perished while digging it twelve myriads 13701 of the Egyptians. Now Necos ceased in the midst of his digging, because the utterance of an Oracle impeded him, which was to the effect that he was working for the Barbarian: and the Egyptians call all men Barbarians who do not agree with them in speech.

159. Thus having ceased from the work of the channel, Necos betook himself to waging wars, and triremes were built by him, some for the Northern Sea and others in the Arabian gulf for the Erythraian Sea; and of these the sheds are still to be seen. These ships he used when he needed them; and also on land Necos engaged battle at Magdolos with the Syrians, and conquered them; and after this he took Cadytis, which is a great city of Syria: and the dress which he wore when he made these conquests he dedicated to Apollo, sending it to Branchidai of the Milesians. After this, having reigned in all sixteen years, he brought his life to an end, and handed on the kingdom to Psammis his son.

160. While this Psammis was king of Egypt, there came to him men sent by the Eleians, who boasted that they ordered the contest at Olympia in the most just and honourable manner possible and thought that not even the Egyptians, the wisest of men, could find out anything besides, to be added to their rules. Now when the Eleians came to Egypt and said that for which they had come, then this king called together those of the Egyptians who were reputed the wisest, and when the Egyptians had come together they heard the Eleians tell of all that which it was their part to do in regard to the contest; and when they had related everything, they said that they had come to learn in addition anything which the Egyptians might be able to find out besides, which was juster than this. They then having consulted together asked the Eleians whether their own citizens took part in the contest; and they said that it was permitted to any one who desired it, both of their own people and of the other Hellenes equally, to take part in the contest: upon which the Egyptians said that in so ordering the games they had wholly missed the mark of justice; for it could not be but that they would take part with the man of their own State, if he was contending, and so act unfairly to the stranger: but if they really desired, as they said, to order the games justly, and if this was the cause for which they had come to Egypt, they advised them to order the contest so as to be for strangers alone to contend in, and that no Eleian should be permitted to contend. Such was the suggestion made by the Egyptians to the Eleians.

161. When Psammis had been king of Egypt for only six years and had made an expedition to Ethiopia and immediately afterwards had ended his life, Apries the son of Psammis received the kingdom in succession. This man came to be the most prosperous of all the kings up to that time except only his forefather Psammetichos; and he reigned five-and-twenty years, during which he led an army against Sidon and fought a sea-fight with the king of Tyre. Since however it was fated that evil should come upon him, it came by occasion of a matter which I shall relate at greater length in the Libyan history, 138 and at present but shortly. Apries having sent a great expedition against the Kyrenians, met with correspondingly great disaster; and the Egyptians considering him to blame for this revolted from him, supposing that Apries had with forethought sent them out to evident calamity, in order (as they said) that there might be a slaughter of them, and he might the more securely rule over the other Egyptians. Being indignant at this, both these men who had returned from the expedition and also the friends of those who had perished made revolt openly.

162. Hearing this Apries sent to them Amasis, to cause them to cease by persuasion; and when he had come and was seeking to restrain the Egyptians, as he was speaking and telling them not to do so, one of the Egyptians stood up behind him and put a helmet 139 upon his head, saying as he did so that he put it on to crown him king. And to him this that was done was in some degree not unwelcome, as he proved by his behaviour; for as soon as the revolted Egyptians had set him up as king, he prepared to march against Apries: and Apries hearing this sent to Amasis one of the Egyptians who were about his own person, a man of reputation, whose name was Patarbemis, enjoining him to bring Amasis alive into his presence. When this Patarbemis came and summoned Amasis, the latter, who happened to be sitting on horseback, lifted up his leg and behaved in an unseemly manner, 140 bidding him take that back to Apries. Nevertheless, they say, Patarbemis made demand of him that he should go to the king, seeing that the king had sent to summon him; and he answered him that he had for some time past been preparing to do so, and that Apries would have no occasion to find fault with him. Then Patarbemis both perceiving his intention from that which he said, and also seeing his preparations, departed in haste, desiring to make known as quickly as possible to the king the things which were being done: and when he came back to Apries not bringing Amasis, the king paying no regard to that which he said, 141 but being moved by violent anger, ordered his ears and his nose to be cut off. And the rest of the Egyptians who still remained on his side, when they saw the man of most repute among them thus suffering shameful outrage, waited no longer but joined the others in revolt, and delivered themselves over to Amasis.

163. Then Apries having heard this also, armed his foreign mercenaries and marched against the Egyptians: now he had about him Carian and Ionian mercenaries to the number of thirty thousand; and his royal palace was in the city of Sa√Øs, of great size and worthy to be seen. So Apries and his army were going against the Egyptians, and Amasis and those with him were going against the mercenaries; and both sides came to the city of Momemphis and were about to make trial of one another in fight.

164. Now of the Egyptians there are seven classes, and of these one class is called that of the priests, and another that of the warriors, while the others are the cowherds, swineherds, shopkeepers, interpreters, and boatmen. This is the number of the classes of the Egyptians, and their names are given them from the occupations which they follow. Of them the warriors are called Calasirians and Hermotybians, and they are of the following districts, 142‚Äîfor all Egypt is divided into districts.
165. The districts of the Hermotybians are those of Busiris, Sa√Øs, Chemmis, Papremis, the island called Prosopitis, and the half of Natho,‚Äîof these districts are the Hermotybians, who reached when most numerous the number of sixteen myriads. 14201 Of these not one has learnt anything of handicraft, but they are given up to war entirely.

166. Again the districts of the Calasirians are those of Thebes, Bubastis, Aphthis, Tanis, Mendes, Sebennytos, Athribis, Pharbaithos, Thmu√Øs Onuphis, Anytis, Myecphoris,‚Äîthis last is on an island opposite to the city of Bubastis. These are the districts of the Calasirians; and they reached, when most numerous, to the number of five-and-twenty myriads 14202 of men; nor is it lawful for these, any more than for the others, to practise any craft; but they practise that which has to do with war only, handing down the tradition from father to son.

167. Now whether the Hellenes have learnt this also from the Egyptians, I am not able to say for certain, since I see that the Thracians also and Scythians and Persians and Lydians and almost all the Barbarians esteem those of their citizens who learn the arts, and the descendants of them, as less honourable than the rest; while those who have got free from all practice of manual arts are accounted noble, and especially those who are devoted to war: however that may be, the Hellenes have all learnt this, and especially the Lacedemonians; but the Corinthians least of all cast slight upon those who practise handicrafts.

168. The following privilege was specially granted to this class and to none others of the Egyptians except the priests, that is to say, each man had twelve yokes 143 of land specially granted to him free from imposts: now the yoke of land measures a hundred Egyptian cubits every way, and the Egyptian cubit is, as it happens, equal to that of Samos. This, I say, was a special privilege granted to all, and they also had certain advantages in turn and not the same men twice; that is to say, a thousand of the Calasirians and a thousand of the Hermotybians acted as body-guard to the king during each year; 144 and these had besides their yokes of land an allowance given them for each day of five pounds weight 14401 of bread to each man, and two pounds of beef, and four half-pints 145 of wine. This was the allowance given to those who were serving as the king's bodyguard for the time being.

169. So when Apries leading his foreign mercenaries, and Amasis at the head of the whole body of the Egyptians, in their approach to one another had come to the city of Momemphis, they engaged battle: and although the foreign troops fought well, yet being much inferior in number they were worsted by reason of this. But Apries is said to have supposed that not even a god would be able to cause him to cease from his rule, so firmly did he think that it was established. In that battle then, I say, he was worsted, and being taken alive was brought away to the city of Sa√Øs, to that which had formerly been his own dwelling but from thenceforth was the palace of Amasis. There for some time he was kept in the palace, and Amasis dealt well with him; but at last, since the Egyptians blamed him, saying that he acted not rightly in keeping alive him who was the greatest foe both to themselves and to him, therefore he delivered Apries over to the Egyptians; and they strangled him, and after that buried him in the burial-place of his fathers: this is in the temple of Athene, close to the sanctuary, on the left hand as you enter. Now the men of Sa√Øs buried all those of this district who had been kings, within the temple; for the tomb of Amasis also, though it is further from the sanctuary than that of Apries and his forefathers, yet this too is within the court of the temple, and it consists of a colonnade of stone of great size, with pillars carved to imitate date-palms, and otherwise sumptuously adorned; and within the colonnade are double-doors, and inside the doors a sepulchral chamber.

170. Also at Sa√Øs there is the burial-place of him whom I account it not pious to name in connexion with such a matter, which is in the temple of Athene behind the house of the goddess, 146 stretching along the whole wall of it; and in the sacred enclosure stand great obelisks of stone, and near them is a lake adorned with an edging of stone and fairly made in a circle, being in size, as it seemed to me, equal to that which is called the ""Round Pool"" 147 in Delos.

171. On this lake they perform by night the show of his sufferings, and this the Egyptians call Mysteries. Of these things I know more fully in detail how they take place, but I shall leave this unspoken; and of the mystic rites of Demeter, which the Hellenes call thesmophoria, of these also, although I know, I shall leave unspoken all except so much as piety permits me to tell. The daughters of Danaos were they who brought this rite out of Egypt and taught it to the women of the Pelasgians; then afterwards when all the inhabitants of Peloponnese were driven out by the Dorians, the rite was lost, and only those who were left behind of the Peloponnesians and not driven out, that is to say the Arcadians, preserved it.

172. Apries having thus been overthrown, Amasis became king, being of the district of Sa√Øs, and the name of the city whence he was is Siuph. Now at the first the Egyptians despised Amasis and held him in no great regard, because he had been a man of the people and was of no distinguished family; but afterwards Amasis won them over to himself by wisdom and not wilfulness. Among innumerable other things of price which he had, there was a foot-basin of gold in which both Amasis himself and all his guests were wont always to wash their feet. This he broke up, and of it he caused to be made the image of a god, and set it up in the city, where it was most convenient; and the Egyptians went continually to visit the image and did great reverence to it. Then Amasis, having learnt that which was done by the men of the city, called together the Egyptians and made known to them the matter, saying that the image had been produced from the foot-basin, into which formerly the Egyptians used to vomit and make water, and in which they washed their feet, whereas now they did to it great reverence; and just so, he continued, had he himself now fared, as the foot-basin; for though formerly he was a man of the people, yet now he was their king, and he bade them accordingly honour him and have regard for him.

173. In such manner he won the Egyptians to himself, so that they consented to be his subjects; and his ordering of affairs was thus:‚ÄîIn the early morning, and until the time of the filling of the market he did with a good will the business which was brought before him; but after this he passed the time in drinking and in jesting at his boon-companions, and was frivolous and playful. And his friends being troubled at it admonished him in some such words as these: ""O king, thou dost not rightly govern thyself in thus letting thyself descend to behaviour so trifling; for thou oughtest rather to have been sitting throughout the day stately upon a stately throne and administering thy business; and so the Egyptians would have been assured that they were ruled by a great man, and thou wouldest have had a better report: but as it is, thou art acting by no means in a kingly fashion."" And he answered them thus: ""They who have bows stretch them at such time as they wish to use them, and when they have finished using them they loose them again; 148 for if they were stretched tight always they would break, so that the men would not be able to use them when they needed them. So also is the state of man: if he should always be in earnest and not relax himself for sport at the due time, he would either go mad or be struck with stupor before he was aware; and knowing this well, I distribute a portion of the time to each of the two ways of living."" Thus he replied to his friends.

174. It is said however that Amasis, even when he was in a private station, was a lover of drinking and of jesting, and not at all seriously disposed; and whenever his means of livelihood failed him through his drinking and luxurious living, he would go about and steal; and they from whom he stole would charge him with having their property, and when he denied it would bring him before the judgment of an Oracle, whenever there was one in their place; and many times he was convicted by the Oracles and many times he was absolved: and then when finally he became king he did as follows:‚Äîas many of the gods as had absolved him and pronounced him not to be a thief, to their temples he paid no regard, nor gave anything for the further adornment of them, nor even visited them to offer sacrifice, considering them to be worth nothing and to possess lying Oracles; but as many as had convicted him of being a thief, to these he paid very great regard, considering them to be truly gods, and to present Oracles which did not lie.

175. First in Sa√Øs he built and completed for Athene a temple-gateway which is a great marvel, and he far surpassed herein all who had done the like before, both in regard to height and greatness, so large are the stones and of such quality. Then secondly he dedicated great colossal statues and man-headed sphinxes very large, and for restoration he brought other stones of monstrous size. Some of these he caused to be brought from the stone-quarries which are opposite Memphis, others of very great size from the city of Elephantine, distant a voyage of not less than twenty days from Sa√Øs: and of them all I marvel most at this, namely a monolith chamber which he brought from the city of Elephantine; and they were three years engaged in bringing this, and two thousand men were appointed to convey it, who all were of the class of boatmen. Of this house the length outside is one-and-twenty cubits, the breadth is fourteen cubits, and the height eight. These are the measures of the monolith house outside; but the length inside is eighteen cubits and five-sixths of a cubit, 149 the breadth twelve cubits, and the height five cubits. This lies by the side of the entrance to the temple; for within the temple they did not draw it, because, as it said, while the house was being drawn along, the chief artificer of it groaned aloud, seeing that much time had been spent and he was wearied by the work; and Amasis took it to heart as a warning and did not allow them to draw it further onwards. Some say on the other hand that a man was killed by it, of those who were heaving it with levers, and that it was not drawn in for that reason.

176. Amasis also dedicated in all the other temples which were of repute, works which are worth seeing for their size, and among them also at Memphis the colossal statue which lies on its back in front of the temple of Hephaistos, whose length is five-and-seventy feet; and on the same base made of the same stone 150 are set two colossal statues, each of twenty feet in length, one on this side and the other on that side of the large statue. 151 There is also another of stone of the same size in Sa√Øs, lying in the same manner as that at Memphis. Moreover Amasis was he who built and finished for Isis her temple at Memphis, which is of great size and very worthy to be seen.

177. In the reign of Amasis it is said that Egypt became more prosperous than at any other time before, both in regard to that which comes to the land from the river and in regard to that which comes from the land to its inhabitants, and that at this time the inhabited towns in it numbered in all twenty thousand. It was Amasis too who established the law that every year each one of the Egyptians should declare to the ruler of his district, from what source he got his livelihood, and if any man did not do this or did not make declaration of an honest way of living, he should be punished with death. Now Solon the Athenian received from Egypt this law and had it enacted for the Athenians, and they have continued to observe it, since it is a law with which none can find fault.


178. Moreover Amasis became a lover of the Hellenes; and besides other proofs of friendship which he gave to several among them, he also granted the city of Naucratis for those of them who came to Egypt to dwell in; and to those who did not desire to stay, but who made voyages thither, he granted portions of land to set up altars and make sacred enclosures for their gods. Their greatest enclosure and that one which has most name and is most frequented is called the Hellenion, and this was established by the following cities in common:‚Äîof the Ionians Chios, Teos, Phocaia, Clazomenai, of the Dorians Rhodes, Cnidos, Halicarnassos, Phaselis, and of the Aiolians Mytilene alone. To these belongs this enclosure and these are the cities which appoint superintendents of the port; and all other cities which claim a share in it, are making a claim without any right. 152 Besides this the Eginetans established on their own account a sacred enclosure dedicated to Zeus, the Samians one to Hera, and the Milesians one to Apollo.

179. Now in old times Naucratis alone was an open trading-place, and no other place in Egypt: and if any one came to any other of the Nile mouths, he was compelled to swear that he came not thither of his own will, and when he had thus sworn his innocence he had to sail with his ship to the Canobic mouth, or if it were not possible to sail by reason of contrary winds, then he had to carry his cargo round the head of the Delta in boats to Naucratis: thus highly was Naucratis privileged.

180. Moreover when the Amphictyons had let out the contract for building the temple which now exists at Delphi, agreeing to pay a sum of three hundred talents, (for the temple which formerly stood there had been burnt down of itself), it fell to the share of the people of Delphi to provide the fourth part of the payment; and accordingly the Delphians went about to various cities and collected contributions. And when they did this they got from Egypt as much as from any place, for Amasis gave them a thousand talents' weight of alum, while the Hellenes who dwelt in Egypt gave them twenty pounds of silver. 153

181. Also with the people of Kyrene Amasis made an agreement for friendship and alliance; and he resolved too to marry a wife from thence, whether because he desired to have a wife of Hellenic race, or apart from that, on account of friendship for the people of Kyrene: however that may be, he married, some say the daughter of Battos, others of Arkesilaos, 154 and others of Critobulos, a man of repute among the citizens; and her name was Ladike. Now whenever Amasis lay with her he found himself unable to have intercourse, but with his other wives he associated as he was wont; and as this happened repeatedly, Amasis said to his wife, whose name was Ladike: ""Woman, thou hast given me drugs, and thou shalt surely perish 155 more miserably than any other woman."" Then Ladike, when by her denials Amasis was not at all appeased in his anger against her, made a vow in her soul to Aphrodite, that if Amasis on that night had intercourse with her (seeing that this was the remedy for her danger), she would send an image to be dedicated to her at Kyrene; and after the vow immediately Amasis had intercourse, and from thenceforth whenever Amasis came in to her he had intercourse with her; and after this he became very greatly attached to her. And Ladike paid the vow that she had made to the goddess; for she had an image made and sent it to Kyrene, and it was still preserved even to my own time, standing with its face turned away from the city of the Kyrenians. This Ladike Cambyses, having conquered Egypt and heard from her who she was, sent back unharmed to Kyrene.

182. Amasis also dedicated offerings in Hellas, first at Kyrene an image of Athene covered over with gold and a figure of himself made like by painting; then in the temple of Athene at Lindson two images of stone and a corslet of linen worthy to be seen; and also at Samos two wooden figures of himself dedicated to Hera, which were standing even to my own time in the great temple, behind the doors. Now at Samos he dedicated offerings because of the guest-friendship between himself and Polycrates the son of Aiakes; at Lindos for no guest-friendship but because the temple of Athene at Lindos is said to have been founded by the daughters of Danaos, who had touched land there at the time when they were fleeing from the sons of Aigyptos. These offerings were dedicated by Amasis; and he was the first of men who conquered Cyprus and subdued it so that it paid him tribute.

11 [ Or ""without rain"": the word {anudros} is altered by some Editors to {enudros} or {euudros}, ""well watered.""]

12 [ I have followed Stein in taking {es ta eiretai} with {legon}, meaning ""at the Erythraian Sea,"" {taute men} being a repetition of {te men} above. The bend back would make the range double, and hence partly its great breadth. Others translate, ""Here (at the quarries) the range stops, and bends round to the parts mentioned (i.e. the Erythraian Sea).""]

13 [ {os einai Aiguptou}: cp. iv. 81. Others translate, ""considering that it belongs to Egypt"" (a country so vast), i.e. ""as measures go in Egypt."" In any case {Aiguptos eousa} just below seems to repeat the same meaning.]

14 [ Some Editors alter this to ""fourteen.""]

16 [ See note on i. 203.]

22 [ i.e. Zeus.]

23 [ i.e. of the district of Thebes, the Theba√Øs.]

24 [ {te Libue}.]

25 [ The meaning seems to be this: ""The Ionians say that Egypt is the Delta, and at the same time they divide the world into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Libya, the last two being divided from one another by the Nile. Thus they have left out Egypt altogether; and either they must add the Delta as a fourth part of the world, or they must give up the Nile as a boundary. If the name Egypt be extended, as it is by the other Hellenes, to the upper course of the Nile, it is then possible to retain the Nile as a boundary, saying that half of Egypt belongs to Asia and half to Libya, and disregarding the Delta (ch. 17). This also would be an error of reckoning, but less serious than to omit Egypt together."" The reasoning is obscure because it alludes to theories (of Hecataios and other writers) which are presumed to be already known to the reader.]

29 [ {ton ta polla esti andri ke k.t.l.} I take {ton} to refer to the nature of the country, as mentioned above; but the use of {os} can hardly be paralleled, and the passage probably requires correction. Some Editors read {ton tekmeria polla esti k.t.l.} ""wherein there are many evidences to prove, etc."" Stein omits {ton} and alters the punctuation, so that the clauses run thus, ""when it flows from the hottest parts to those which for the most part are cooler? For a man who is capable of reasoning about such matters the first and greatest evidence to prove that it is not likely to flow from snow, is afforded by the winds, etc.""]

37 [ I have little doubt that this means the island of Elephantine; for at this point only would such a mixture of races be found. To this the writer here goes back parenthetically, and then resumes the account of the journey upwards from Tachompso.

62 [ Or, ""for what end this night is held solemn by lighting of lamps"" (B.R.), making {phos kai timen} one idea.]

63 [ {alexomenous}: this, which is adopted by most Editors, is the reading of some less good MSS.; the rest have {alexomenoi}, ""strike them and defend themselves.""]

by Stein.]

68 [ {pante}, which by some is translated ""taken all together,"" ""at most."" Perhaps there is some corruption of text, and the writer meant to say that it measured two cubits by one cubit.]

6801 [ The reading of the Medicean MS. is {en esti}, not {enesti} as hitherto reported.]

69 [ Or, ""calling the song Linos.""]

70 [ {ton Linon okothen elabon}: the MSS. have {to ounoma} after {elabon}, but this is omitted by almost all Editors except Stein, who justifies it by a reference to ch. 50, and understands it to mean ""the person of Linos."" No doubt the song and the person are here spoken off indiscriminately, but this explanation would require the reading {tou Linou}, as indeed Stein partly admits by suggesting the alteration.]

71 [ The words ""and Bacchic (which are really Egyptian),"" are omitted by several of the best MSS.]

81 [ {zuga}, to tie the sides and serve as a partial deck.]

82 [ {esti de oud' outos}: a few MSS. have {ouk} instead of {oud'}, and most Editors follow them. The meaning however seems to be that even here the course in time of flood is different, and much more in the lower parts.]

83 [ {os apergmenos ree}: the MSS. mostly have {os apergmenos reei}, in place of which I have adopted the correction of Stein. Most other Editors read {os apergmenos peei} (following a few inferior MSS.), ""the bend of the Nile which flows thus confined.""]

84 [ Not therefore in the Delta, to which in ch. 15 was assigned a later origin than this.]

85 [ {kat' ouden einai lamprotetos}: Stein reads {kai} for {kat'}, thus making the whole chapter parenthetical, with {ou gar elegon} answered by {parameipsamenos on}, a conjecture which is ingenious but not quite convincing.]

86 [ {stratien pollen labon}: most of the MSS. have {ton} after {pollen}, which perhaps indicates that some words are lost.]

87 [ {kai prosotata}: many MSS. have {kai ou prosotata}, which is defended by some Editors in the sense of a comparative, ""and not further.""]

88 [ {Suroi} in the better MSS.; see note in i.6.]

89 [ {Surioi}.]

90 [ {kata tauta}: the better MSS. have {kai kata tauta}, which might be taken with what follows, punctuating after {ergazontai} (as in the Medicean MS.): ""they and the Egyptians alone of all nations work flax; and so likewise they resemble one another in their whole manner of living.""]

91 [ {polon}, i.e. the concave sun-dial, in shape like the vault of heaven.]

92 [ The gnomon would be an upright staff or an obelisk for observation of the length of the shadow.]

93 [ i.e. Red Clod.]

94 [ {Turion stratopedon}, i.e. ""the Tyrian quarter"" of the town: cp. ch. 154.]

95 [ {ten sen}, or {tauten}, ""this land.""]

96 [ {es o meteke auton}, ""until at last he dismissed it""; but the construction is very irregular, and there is probably some corruption of text. Stein reads {ekon} by conjecture for {es o}.]

97 [ {delon de kata per epoiese}: a conjectural emendation of {delon de' kata gar epoiese}, which some editors retain, translating thus, ""and this is clear; for according to the manner in which Homer described the wanderings of Alexander, etc., it is clear how, etc.""]

98 [ Il. vi. 289. The sixth book is not ordinarily included in the {Diomedeos aristeia}.]

99 [ Od. iv. 227. These references to the Odyssey are by some thought to be interpolations, because they refer only to the visit of Menelaos to Egypt after the fall of Troy; but Herodotus is arguing that Homer, while rejecting the legend of Helen's stay in Egypt during the war, yet has traces of it left in this later visit to Egypt of Menelaos and Helen, as well as in the visit of Paris and Helen to Sidon.]

100 [ Od. iv. 351.]

101 [ {kai tode to khorion}: probably {to khorion} ought to be struck out: ""this also is evident.""]

102 [ {podeonas}, being the feet of the animals whose skins they were.]

103 [ Cp. vii. 152.]

104 [ {elasai}, which may be intransitive, ""rushed into every kind of evil.""]

105 [ {stadioi}.]

106 [ {krossas}.]

107 [ {bomidas}.]

108 [ i.e. the three small pyramids just to the East of the great pyramid.]

109 [ {oute gar k.t.l.}, ""for there are no underground chambers,"" etc. Something which was in the mind of the writer has been omitted either by himself or his copyists, ""and inferior to it also in other respects, for,"" etc. unless, as Stein supposes, we have here a later addition thrown in without regard to the connexion.]

110 [ {touto megathos}, ""as regards attaining the same size,"" but probably the text is corrupt. Stein reads {to megathos} in his later editions.]

111 [ Or, ""Philition.""]

112 [ {to theo}, the goddess Leto, cp. i. 105.]

113 [ {suntakhunein auton ton bion}: some MSS. and Editors read {auto} for {auton}, ""that heaven was shortening his life.""]

114 [ More literally, ""bidding him take up the blood-money, who would."" The people of Delphi are said to have put Esop to death and to have been ordered by the Oracle to make compensation.]

115 [ {os an einai 'Podopin}: so the MSS. Some Editors read {'Podopios}, others {'Podopi}.]

116 [ {antion de autout tou neou}.]

117 [ {epaphroditoi ginesthai}.]

118 [ {katekertomese min}: Athen√¶us says that Sappho attacked the mistress of Charaxos; but here {min} can hardly refer to any one but Charaxos himself, who doubtless would be included in the same condemnation.]

119 [ {propulaia}.]

120 [ ""innumerable sights of buildings.""]

121 [ {tassomenon}, ""posted,"" like an army; but the text is probably unsound: so also in the next line, where the better MSS. have {men Boubasti poli}, others {e en Boubasti polis}. Stein reads {e en Boubasti poli}, ""the earth at the city of Bubastis."" Perhaps {e en Boubasti polis} might mean the town as opposed to the temple, as Mr. Woods suggests.]

122 [ Cp. ch. 161, {egeneto apo prophasios, ton k.t.l.} Perhaps however {prophasin} is here from {prophaino} (cp. Soph. Trach. 662), and it means merely ""that the gods were foreshowing him this in order that,"" etc. So Stein.]

123 [ i.e. for their customary gift or tribute to him as king.]

124 [ The chronology is inconsistent, and some propose, without authority, to read ""three hundred years.""]

125 [ {tas arouras}, cp. ch. 168, where the {aroura} is defined as a hundred Egyptian units square, about three-quarters of an acre.]

126 [ {es to megaron}.]

127 [ Not on two single occasions, but for two separate periods of time it was stated that the sun had risen in the West and set in the East; i.e. from East to West, then from West to East, then again from East to West, and finally back to East again. This seems to be the meaning attached by Herodotus to something which he was told about astronomical cycles.]

128 [ {ouk eontas}: this is the reading of all the best MSS., and also fits in best with the argument, which was that in Egypt gods were quite distinct from men. Most Editors however read {oikeontas} on the authority of a few MSS., ""dwelling with men."" (The reading of the Medicean MS. is {ouk eontas}, not {oukeontas} as stated by Stein.)]

129 [ i.e. that the Hellenes borrowed these divinities from Egypt, see ch. 43 ff. This refers to all the three gods above mentioned and not (as Stein contended) to Pan and Dionysos only.]

130 [ {kai toutous allous}, i.e. as well as Heracles; but it may mean ""that these also, distinct from the gods, had been born,"" etc. The connexion seems to be this: ""I expressed my opinion on all these cases when I spoke of the case of Heracles; for though the statement there about Heracles was in one respect inapplicable to the rest, yet in the main conclusion that gods are not born of men it applies to all.""]

131 [ {stadioi}.]

132 [ {mneas}, of which 60 go to the talent.]

133 [ Cp. ch. 112.]

134 [ {neos}.]

135 [ I understand that each wall consisted of a single stone, which gave the dimensions each way: ""as regards height and length"" therefore it was made of a single stone. That it should have been a monolith, except the roof, is almost impossible, not only because of the size mentioned (which in any case is suspicious), but because no one would so hollow out a monolith that it would be necessary afterwards to put on another stone for the roof. The monolith chamber mentioned in ch. 175, which it took three years to convey from Elephantine, measured only 21 cubits by 14 by 8. The {parorophis} or ""cornice"" is not an ""eave projecting four cubits,"" but (as the word is explained by Pollux) a cornice between ceiling and roof, measuring in this instance four cubits in height and formed by the thickness of the single stone: see Letronne, Recherches pour servir, etc. p. 80 (quoted by B√§hr).]

136 [ {erpase}, ""took as plunder.""]

137 [ {aparti}: this word is not found in any MS. but was read here by the Greek grammarians.]

13701 [ i.e. 120,000.]


138 [ Cp. iv. 159.]

139 [ {kuneen}, perhaps the royal helmet or Pschent, cp. ch. 151.]

140 [ {apemataise}, euphemism for breaking wind.]

141 [ {oudena logon auto donta}: many Editors change {auto} to {eouto}, in which case it means ""taking no time to consider the matter,"" as elsewhere in Herodotus; but cp. iii. 50 {istoreonti logon audena edidou}.]

142 [ {nomon}, and so throughout the passage.]

14201 [ i.e. 160,000.]

14202 [ i.e. 250,000.]

143 [ {arourai}, cp. ch. 141.]

144 [ {ekaston}: if {ekastoi} be read (for which there is more MS. authority) the meaning will be that ""a thousand Calasirians and a thousand Hermotybians acted as guards alternately, each for a year,"" the number at a time being 1000 not 2000.]

14401 [ {pente mneai}.]

145 [ {arusteres},={kotulai}.]

146 [ {tou neou}.]

147 [ {e trokhoiedes kaleomene}, ""the Wheel.""]

148 [ The last words, ""and when‚Äîagain,"" are not found in the best MSS., and are omitted by Stein. However their meaning, if not expressed, is implied.]

149 [ {pugonos}.]

150 [ {tou autou eontes lithou}: some MSS. and many Editors have {Aithiopikou} for {tou autou}, ""of Ethiopian stone."" For {eontes} the MSS. have {eontos}, which may be right, referring to {tou bathrou} understood, ""the base being made of,"" etc.]

151 [ {tou megalou}, a conjecture founded upon Valla's version, which has been confirmed by a MS. The other MSS. have {tou megarou}, which is retained by some Editors, ""on each side of the sanctuary.""]

152 [ ""are claiming a share when no part in it belongs to them.""]

153 [ Or possibly of alum: but the gift seems a very small one in any case. Some propose to read {eikosi mneas khrusou}.]

[Coro: Payo Sol√≠s]
Me queda 1%
Y lo usar√© solo para decirte lo mucho que lo siento
Que si me ven con otra en una disco solo es perdiendo el tiempo
Baby, ¬øpa' qu√© te miento?
Eso de que me vieron feliz, no, no es cierto

[Verso 1: Payo Sol√≠s]
Ya nada me hace re√≠r
Solo cuando veo las fotos y los v√≠deos que tengo de ti
Sal√≠ con otra para olvidarte y ten√≠a el perfume que te gusta a ti
Prendo para irme a dormir
Porque duermo mejor si sue√±o que est√°s aqu√≠
Si supieras que te escrib√≠
No he mandado los mensajes, siguen todos ah√≠
Wow, qu√© mucho me ha costa'o
Quiz√°s te hice un favor cuando me fui de tu lado
Borracho viendo tus fotos, me duele ver que t√∫ s√≠ has mejorado
No tienes d√≠as grises, ya no te duelen las cicatrices
Y yo pensando si decirte que

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?

(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Bridge]
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""

[Breakdown]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees

At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)

I don't wanna spend another night alone
Reaching for the space you left in our bed tonight
So I guess I'll call some buddies up
Get gone, take another shot in some Broadway dive
I might give you a drunk dial
Just to tell you what you already know

[Chorus]
Baby I'm in trouble
Steady missing you
I'm getting through another double
A white flag waving, come and save me
Might be reckless but I can't help it
So if you could would you just come back home?
'Cause baby I'm in trouble
Baby I'm in trouble

Heading straight for another memory
Trying to stay afloat on this old barstool
Wishing you would call but you won't
That it'll get b–µtter but it don't

I could never hate you even if I tried
Girl, I love you too much and I've loved you too long to fight
Mm
It ain't always a bad thing saying goodbye
And the last thing that I wanna be is a waste of your time

Don't let one teardrop fall
Girl, you think it's your fault but it isn't
I fell in love and you didn't

There's so much goin' on in this town
To keep me busy, I've been runnin' around
Up and down all these avenues
Doin' everything but thinkin' 'bout you
As long as I stay on 'em, I'm fine
The city side of those city limit signs
You don't really cross my mind

[Chorus]
But soon as I get out here on the outskirts
I wish I was runnin' by your house first
Somethin' 'bout a summer in the south sure
Shines like gold down these old
Round bail, river valley back roads
Way back in the holler where the grass grows
God almighty, baby, we were that close
To ditchin' this town and settlin' down
Out here on the outskirts

[Verse 2]
If I'da had a lick of damn sense
I'd be on the greener side of that fence
Little starter house we've finally outgrown
Twelve-hundred feet we're 'bout to add on
Smilin' out there watchin' them
Big ol' yellow buckets 'bout to break ground
While you're shootin' all my baby names down

If someone told me that the world would end tonight

And for once it would be easier
I can tell my friends I'm fine if I want to
I don't have to call you mine, mine, mine

Verse 2

I can say goodbye to your memory
I can learn how to like the company
I keep when I'm all by myself
'Cause without you, life is much easier

Chorus
I can pretend like it never happened
And for once it would be easier
I can tell my friends I'm fine if I want to
I don't have to call you mine, mine, mine

Bridge
I can tell you I'm doin' good
I don't wanna cause a scene
I know I'm makin' progress
But I can only grin and bear it
'Cause I know someday I'll get over you

Chorus
I can pretend like it never happened
And for once it would be easier
I can tell my friends I'm fine if I want to
I don't have to call you mine, mine, mine

I can buy myself flowers
I can learn how to force my own smile
I can talk to myself in the mirror
For a whole goddamn minute
I can pretend like it never happened
And for once it would be easier
I can tell my friends I'm fine if I want to
I don't have to call you mine, mine, mine

[Instrumental Break]

I can pretend like it never happened
And for once it would be easier
I can tell my friends I'm fine if I want to

[Verso 1: Pedro Tovar & Peso Pluma]
Mi compa, ¬øqu√© le parece esa morra?
La que anda bailando sola me gusta pa' m√≠
¬°Bella! Ella sabe que est√° buena
Que todos andan mir√°ndola c√≥mo baila
Me acerco y le tiro todo un verbo
Tomamos tragos sin peros, solo tentaci√≥n
Le dije: ""Voy a conquistar tu familia, que en unos d√≠as vas a ser m√≠a""
Me dijo que estoy muy loco, pero le gusta
Que ning√∫n vato como yo act√∫a

[Interludio: Pedro Tovar & Peso Pluma]
Y ah√≠ te va, mija
Y pura Doble P, viejo
As√≠ nom√°s, compa Pedro
Puro Eslabon Armado
Pa' las plebitas
¬°Cha-chau!

[Verso 2: Peso Pluma & Pedro Tovar]
No soy un vato que tiene varo
Pero hablando del coraz√≥n te cumplo todo
Me agarr√≥ pegadito d–µ su mano
Mi compa ni se la crey√≥, que al pasar fui yo
Su cu–µrpo, juro por Dios, que era tan perfecta
Su cinturita como modelo
Sus ojos desde el principio me enamoraron
A ella le gusto y a m√≠ me gusta

I walk London with the [?] five fingers of  death
Leave MCs with five fingers or less
Sex Mel B [?] finger the rest
[?]
I piss on your face and make you as wet
As the victims of the Marchioness
I'm the last you wanna test
[?] like your mum dressing up a Flash Gordon
And your dad like Ming the Merciless
In school I used to grab girl chest
Now I grab up MCs and butt them
Till they smoke cocaine in their sets

[Verse 2, Jehst]
I hit dew
And swap tin boots for gym shoes
Moving like a cool cat
On a hot tin roof
Sugar lipped, sweet tooth
[?] food and drink brews
[?] fools hustling
Rustling king blues
Card shuffling
But we're only playing for fun
Soaking up the solar power as we lay in the Sun
We bun the soul flower now
Until the day is done
I twist spinach
And sip Guinness
Until this script's finished
You might also like[Verse 3, Profound]
Case is no one
We shine with no Sun
There's no guns
Cash is lonesome
So there's no funds
We flow some
What
Competitive
But sucking on A&R private parts
Is still now repetitive
So
My etiquette is [no land dragon ?]
There's basically no British rap bandwagon
That the fans happen to have
It's Hip-Hop
So what if after that you went down the pub
And after that up to the chip shop?

[Chorus, Supa T and vocoder]
Say Ugh!
Do the salsa smurf
Ruff!

[Verse 4, Supa T]
Django smash your party night like Harry White
My sick team carry dirty funk clean
Slaughter beats by Mr Sheen
Yeah I'm [?] to the elements
So I don't need a Walkman
Make you choke on your bad words
Tie knots in your [?]
Champions come humdrum?
You won't be seeing that
Smack heavy on the track
While you're curing insomniacs
Spit your boring arse babble raps
I stay zoning
Get the b-boys off the floor so we can groove for a moment
[Verse 5, Lewis Parker]
They get smoked out like Cheech
Do this for one and each
While I'm standing on the beach
Singing ""Save The World""
Think of all the fly girls going crazy for the kiwi
Trying to keep it simple so the suckers think it's easy
So when they try to bite
They get confused
Trying to take it out
But
Nature doesn't lose
We're on a funk cruise
So sit back and enjoy
With Sun vibes like Roy
Because we're keeping all the airs
With the kicks, hats and snares
Break it down to the bares
I said your DJ's got the flairs
But he can't do the [?]
My DJ rocks the old style
And all the girls love it
Play this out like a puppet
Old theories recovered
It's a special request
Salsa Smurf's how we does it
[Supa T]
So get your boys out
And don't dub it!
[Verse 6, L.Dolo with vocoder]
Now it's time for something new
Something borrowed, something old
Something broken down and put together again
By who?
L Dolo
So if you wonder why the sky's blue
It's reflections from the SP
Specifically from Fuji
And me?
I'm just a hip-hop loving MC
The type you wish you were
But you're still claiming to be
Dropping clue likes a lazy Dr Watson
So you don't get the point
I will administer general anaesthetic
No option
One artist
More [?] and [?]
Seven champions
By name and by nature
Do the
Salsa
Salsa, salsa, salsa
Salsa
Salsa, salsa, salsa

[Chorus, Supa T and vocoder]
Say Ugh!
Do the salsa smurf
Ruff!
Do the salsa smurf
Who's that girl?
Now by law
Do the salsa smurf

So everybody go Ughh!
Do the salsa smurf

Represent South London
Southampton Way street bunning
Walk through [player darkness?]
With a viking lantern

Django Van Helsing
Future warrior like [?]
Whites on the table
Put your wedge on the table

Iron bars will close you down
So I don't hang around
'Cause you can't have what you ain't found

[Jehst]
Speaking sunset syllables
Spitting the summer vibe
Bringing my kaleidoscopic eye to the colour blind
Leaving rhymes written and underlined
Making you wonder why
I didn't say shit on the other side

[L. Dolo]
Jalape√±o salsa dip
Tortilla chips
Inky fingers reminisce
For what's it worth do the smurf shit

[Apollo]
Off the head, I vex the dead
I kick the garage youts in the ped
And give them baggy slacks instead

Broken vampire slayer
Heavy metal soul man
One man hundred hand
For redneck back sperm[?]

Call me the water in the oceans

[Coro: Payo Sol√≠s]
Me queda 1%
Y lo usar√© solo para decirte lo mucho que lo siento
Que si me ven con otra en una disco solo es perdiendo el tiempo
Baby, ¬øpa' qu√© te miento?
Eso de que me vieron feliz, no, no es cierto

Ya nada me hace re√≠r
Solo cuando veo las fotos y los v√≠deos que tengo de ti
Sal√≠ con otra para olvidarte y ten√≠a el perfume que te gusta a ti
Prendo para irme a dormir
Porque duermo mejor si sue√±o que est√°s aqu√≠
Si supieras que te escrib√≠
No he mandado los mensajes, siguen todos ah√≠

433,Queen of Belle la Vie,The Band That Saved The World,Name in Lights,33,"2 ContributorsArabian Nights,Vol. 2 (Chap. 3) LyricsTale of King Omar Bin Al-Nu'uman and His Sons Sharrkan and Zau Al-Makan

And What Befel Them of Things Seld-Seen and Peregrine.[FN#138]

The King asked her, ""And what was their story?"" and she answered: It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that there was in the City of Safety, Baghdad, before the Caliphate of Abd al-Malik bin Marw√°n,[FN#139] a King, Omar bin al-Nu'um√°n highs, who was of the mighty giants and had subjected the Chosro√´s of Persia and the Kaysars of Eastern Rome; for none could warm himself at his fire;[FN#140] nor could any avail to meet him in the field of foray and fray; and, when he was angered, there came forth from his nostrils sparks of flame. He had made himself King over all quarters, and Allah had subjected to him all His creatures; his word went forth to all great cities and his hosts had harried the farthest lands. East and West had come under his command with whatsoever regions lay interspersed between them, Hind and Sind and Sin,[FN#141] the Holy Land, Al-Hijaz, the rich mountains of Al-Yaman and the archipelagos of India and China. Moreover, he reigned supreme over the north country and Diy√°r Bakr, or Mesopotamia, and over Sud√°n, the Eastern Negro land and the Islands of the Ocean, and all the far famed rivers of the earth, Sayh√∫n and Jayh√∫n,[FN#142] Nile and Euphrates. He sent envoys and ambassadors to capitals the most remote, to provide him with true report; and they would bring back tidings of justice and peace, with assurance of loyalty and obedience and of prayers in the pulpits for King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; for he was, O Ruler of the Age, a right noble King; and there came to him presents of rarities and toll and tribute from all lands of his governing. This mighty monarch had a son yclept Sharrkan,[FN#143] who was likest of all men to his father and who proved himself one of the prodigies of his time for subduing the brave and bringing his contemporaries to bane and ban. For this his father loved him with love so great none could be greater, and made him heir to the kingdom after himself. This Prince grew up till he reached man's estate and was twenty years old, and Allah subjected His servants to him, by reason of his great might and prowess in battle. Now his father, King Omar, had four wives legally married, but Allah had vouchsafed him no son by them, save Sharrkan, whom he had begotten upon one of them, and the rest were barren. Moreover he had three hundred and sixty concubines, after the number of days in the Coptic year, who were of all nations; and he had furnished for each and every a private chamber within his own palace. For he had built twelve pavilions, after the number of the months, each containing thirty private chambers, which thus numbered three hundred and three score, wherein he lodged his handmaids: and he appointed according to law for each one her night, when he lay with her and came not again to her for a full year;[FN#144] and on this wise he abode for a length of time. Meanwhile his son Sharrkan was making himself renowned in all quarters of the world and his father was proud of him and his might waxed and grew mightier; so that he passed all bounds and bore himself masterfully and took by storm castles and cities. Presently, by decree of the Decreer, a handmaid among the handmaids of Omar bin Nu'uman became pregnant; and, her pregnancy being announced to the Harim, the King was informed thereof; whereupon he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said, ""Haply it will be a son, and so all my offspring will be males!"" Then he documented the date of her conception and entreated her with all manner of kindness. But when the tidings came to Sharrkan, he was troubled and the matter seemed to him a sore one and a grievous; and he said, ""Verily one cometh who shall dispute with me the sovereignty:"" so quoth he to himself, ""If this concubine bear a male child I will kill it:"" but he kept that intention hidden in his heart. Such was the case with Sharrkan; but what happened in the matter of the damsel was as follows. She was a Roumiyah, a Greek girl, by name Sofiyah or Sophia,[FN#145] whom the King of Roum and Lord of C√¶sarea had sent to King Omar as a present, together with great store of gifts and of rarities: she was the fairest of favour and loveliest of all his handmaids and the most regardful of her honour; and she was gifted with a wit as penetrating as her presence was fascinating. Now she had served the King on the night of his sleeping with her, saying to him, ""O King! I desire of the God of the Heavens that he bless thee this night with a male child by me, so I may bring him up with the best of rearing, and enable him to reach man's estate perfect in intelligence, good manners and prudent bearing""[FN#146]‚Äîa speech which much pleased the King. During her pregnancy she was instant in prayer, fervently supplicating the Lord to bless her with a goodly male child and make his birth easy to her; and Allah heard her petition so that after her months were accomplished she sat safely upon the birth stool.[FN#147] Now the King had deputed a eunuch to let him know if the child she should bring forth were male or female; and in like way his son Sharrkan had sent one to bring him tidings of the same. In due time Sophia was delivered of a child, which the midwives examined and found to be a girl with a face sheenier than the moon. So they announced this to all present in the room, whereupon the King's messenger carried the news to him; and Sharrkan's eunuch did the like with his master who rejoiced with exceeding joy. But, after the two had departed, quoth Sophia to the midwives, ""Wait with me awhile, for I feel as if there were still somewhat in my womb."" Then she cried out and the pains of child bed again took her; and Allah made it easy to her and she gave birth to a second child. The wise women looked at it and found it a boy like the full moon, with forehead flower white, and cheek ruddy bright with rosy light; whereupon the mother rejoiced, as did the eunuchs and attendants and all the company; and Sophia was delivered of the after birth whilst all in the palace sent forth the trill of joy.[FN#148] The rest of the concubines heard it and envied her lot; and the tidings reached Omar son of Al- Nu'uman, who was glad and rejoiced at the excellent news. Then he rose and went to her and kissed her head, after which he looked at the boy; and, bending over him, kissed him, whilst the damsels struck the tabors and played on instruments of music; and the King gave order that the boy should be named Zau al-Mak√°n and his sister Nuzhat al-Zam√°n.[FN#149] They answered ""Hearing and obedience,"" and did his bidding; so he appointed wet nurses and dry nurses and eunuchs and attendants to serve them; and assigned them rations of sugar and diet drinks and unguents and else beside, beyond the power of tongue to rehearse. Moreover the people of Baghdad, hearing that Allah had blessed their King with issue, decorated the city and made proclamation of the glad tidings with drum and tom tom; and the Emirs and Wazirs and high dignitaries came to the palace and wished King Omar bin al-Nu'uman joy of his son, Zau al-Makan, and of his daughter Nuzhat al-Zaman, wherefore he thanked them and bestowed on them dresses of honour and further favoured them with gifts, and dealt largesse to all, gentle and simple, who were present. After this fashion he did for four days full told, and he lavished upon Sophia raiment and ornaments and great store of wealth; and, every few days he would send a messenger to ask after her and the new-borns. And when four years had gone by, he provided her with the wherewithal to rear the two children carefully and educate them with the best of instructions. All this while his son Sharrkan knew not that a male child had been born to his father, Omar son of Al-Nu'uman, having news only that he had been blessed with the birth of Nuzhat al-Zaman; and they hid the intelligence from him, until days and years had sped by, whilst he was busied in battling with the brave and fighting single handed against the knights. One day, as King Omar was sitting in his palace, his Chamberlains came in to him and, kissing the ground before him, said, ""O King there be come Ambassadors from the King of Roum, Lord of Constantinople the Great, and they desire admission to thee and submission to thy decree: if the King commend us to introduce them we will so do; and, if not, there is no disputing his behest."" He bade them enter and, when they came in, he turned to them and, courteously receiving them, asked them of their case, and what was the cause of their coming. They kissed the ground before him and said, ""O King glorious and strong! O lord of the arm that is long! know that he who despatched us to thee is King Afr√≠d√∫n,[FN#150] Lord of Ionia land[FN#151] and of the Nazarene armies, the sovereign who is firmly established in the empery of Constantinople, to acquaint thee that he is now waging fierce war and fell with a tyrant and a rebel, the Prince of Casarea; and the cause of this war is as follows. One of the Kings of the Arabs in past time, during certain of his conquests, chanced upon a hoard of the time of Alexander,[FN#152] whence he removed wealth past compute; and, amongst other things, three round jewels, big as ostrich eggs, from a mine of pure white gems whose like was never seen by man. Upon each were graven characts in Ionian characters, and they have many virtues and properties, amongst the rest that if one of these jewels be hung round the neck of a new-born child, no evil shall befal him and he shall neither wail, nor shall fever ail him as long as the jewel remain without fail.[FN#153] When the Arab King laid hands upon them and learned their secrets, he sent to King Afridun presents of certain rarities and amongst them the three jewels afore mentioned; and he equipped for the mission two ships, one bearing the treasure and the other men of might to guard it from any who might offer hindrance on the high seas, albeit well assured that none would dare waylay his vessels, for that he was King of the Arabs, and more by token that their course lay over waters subject to the King of Constantinople and they were bound to his port; nor were there on the shores of that sea any save the subjects of the Great King, Afridun. The two ships set out and voyaged till they drew near our city, when there sallied out on them certain corsairs from that country and amongst them troops from the Prince of Caesarea, who took all the treasures and rarities in the ships, together with the three jewels, and slew the crews. When our King heard of this, he sent an army against them, but they routed it; then he marched a second and a stronger but they put this also to flight,‚Äîwhereupon the King waxed wroth and swore that he would not go forth[FN#154] against them save in his own person at the head of his whole army; nor would he turn back from them till he had left Caesarea, of Armenia[FN#155] in ruins and had laid waste all the lands and cities over which her Prince held sway. So he sent us to the Lord of the age and the time, Sultan Omar bin al-Nu'uman, King of Baghdad and of Khorasan, desiring that he aid us with an army, so may honour and glory accrue to him; and he hath also forwarded by us somewhat of various kinds of presents, and of the King's grace he beggeth their acceptance and the friendly boon of furtherance."" Then the Ambassadors kissed the ground before him,‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Forty-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that, after the Ambassadors and retinue from the Constantinopolitan King had kissed the ground before Omar and had delivered their embassage, they brought out the presents, which were fifty damsels of the choicest from Graecia-land, and fifty Mamelukes in tunics of brocade, belted with girdles of gold and silver, each wearing in his ears hoops of gold with pendants of fine pearls costing a thousand ducats every one. The girls were adorned in like fashion and were clad in stuffs worth a treasury of money. When the King saw them, he rejoiced in them and accepted them; then he bade the Ambassadors be honourably entreated and, summoning his Wazirs, took counsel with them of what he should do. Herewith rose up among them a Wazir, an ancient man, Dandan[FN#156] highs, who kissed the ground before Omar and said, ""O King, there is nothing better to do in this matter than equip an army valiant and victorious, and set over it thy son Sharrkan with us as his lieutenants; and this rede commendeth itself to me on two counts; first, because the King of Roum hath invoked thine assistance and hath sent thee gifts which thou hast accepted; and, secondly, because while no enemy dareth attack our country, thine army may go forth safely and, should it succour the King of Graecia-land and defeat his foe, the glory will be thine. Moreover, the news of it will be noised abroad in all cities and countries and especially, when the tidings shall reach the Islands of the Ocean and the Kings of Mauritania shall hear it, they will send thee offerings of rarities and pay thee tribute of money."" The King pleased by the Wazir's words and approving his rede, gave him a dress of honour and said to him, ""Of the like of thee should Kings ask counsel, and it seemeth fit that thou shouldst conduct the van of our army and our son Sharrkan command the main battle."" Then he sent for his son who came and kissed ground before him and sat down; and he expounded to him the matter, telling him what the Ambassadors and the Wazir Dandan had said, and he charged him to take arms and equip himself for the campaign, enjoining him not to gainsay Dandan in aught he should do. Moreover, he ordered him to pick out of his army ten thousand horsemen, armed cap-√†-pie and inured to onset and stress of war. Accordingly, Sharrkan arose on the instant, and chose out a myriad of horsemen, after which he entered his palace and mustered his host and distributed largesse to them, saying, ""Ye have delay of three days."" They kissed the earth before him in obedience to his commands and began at once to lay in munitions, and provide provisions for the occasion; whilst Sharrkan repaired to the armouries and took therefrom whatsoever he required of arms and armour, and thence to the stable where he chose horses of choice blood and others. When the appointed three days were ended, the army drew out to the suburbs of Baghdad city;[FN#157] and King Omar came forth to take leave of his son who kissed the ground before him and received from the King seven parcels of money.[FN#158] Then he turned to Danden and commended to his care the army of his son; and the Wazir kissed the ground before him and answered, ""I hear and I obey;"" and lastly he charged Sharrkan that he should consult the Wazir on all occasions, which he promised to do. After this, the King returned to his city and Sharrkan ordered the officers to muster their troops in battle array. So they mustered them and their number was ten thousand horsemen, besides footmen and camp followers. Then they loaded their baggage on their beasts and the war drums beat and the trumpets blared and the bannerols and standards were unfurled, whilst Sharrkan mounted horse, with the Wazir Dandan by his side, and the colours fluttering over their heads. So the host fared forth and stinted not faring, with the ambassadors preceding them, till day departed and night drew nigh, when they alighted and encamped for the night. And as soon as Allah caused the morn tomorrow, they mounted and tried on, guided by the Ambassadors, for a space of twenty days; and by the night of the twenty first they came to a fine and spacious Wady well grown with trees and shrubbery. Here Sharrkan ordered them to alight and commanded a three days' halt, so they dismounted and pitched their tents, spreading their camp over the right and the left slopes of the extensive valley, whilst the Wazir Dandan and the Ambassadors of King Afridun pitched in the sole of the Wady.[FN#159] As for Sharrkan, he tarried behind them for awhile till all had dismounted and had dispersed themselves over the valley sides; he then slacked the reins of his steed, being minded to explore the Wady and to mount guard in his own person, because of his father's charge and owing to the fact that they were on the frontier of Graecia land and in the enemy's country. So he rode out alone after ordering his armed slaves and his body guard to camp near the Wazir Dandan, and he fared on along the side of the valley till a fourth part of the night was passed, when he felt tired and drowsiness overcame him, so that he could no longer urge horse with heel. Now he was accustomed to take rest on horseback; so when slumber overpowered him, he slept and the steed ceased not going on with him till half the night was spent and entered one of the thickets[FN#160] which was dense with growth; but Sharrkan awoke not until his horse stumbled over wooded ground. Then he started from sleep and found himself among the trees, and the moon arose and shone brightly over the two horizons, Eastern and Western. He was startled when he found himself alone in this place and said the say which ne'er yet shamed its sayer, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!"" But as he rode on, in fear of wild beasts, behold, the moon spread her glad light over a meadow as if it were of the meads of Paradise; and he heard pleasant voices and a loud noise of talk and laughter captivating the senses of men. So King Sharrkan alighted and, tying his steed to one of the trees, went over a little way till he came upon a stream and heard a woman talking in Arabic and saying, ""Now by the crush of the Messiah, this is not well of you! but whose utters a word, I will throw her and truss her up with her own girdle[FN#161]!"" He kept walking in the direction of the sound and when he reached the further side he looked and behold, a stream was gushing and flowing, and antelopes at large were frisking and roving, and wild cattle amid the pasture moving, and birds expressed joy and gladness in their divers tongues, and that place was purfled with all manner flowers and green herbs, even as a poet described it in these couplets,

""Most beautiful is earth in budding bloom, * When lucid waters
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    course through plain and wood:
No work but His th' All great, th' All glorious, * Giver of all
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    gifts, Giver of all good!""

And as Sharrkan considered the place, he saw in it a Christian Monastery within whose enceinte a castle towered high in air catching the light of the moon.[FN#162] Through the midst of the convent passed a stream, the water flowing amongst its gardens; and upon the bank sat the woman whose voice he had heard, while before her stood ten handmaids like moons and wearing various sorts of raiment and ornaments that dazed and dazzled the beholder, high bosomed virgins, as saith of them the poet in these couplets,

""The mead is bright with what is on't * Of merry maidens
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    debonnair:
Double its beauty and its grace * Those trooping damsels slender-
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   fair:
Virgins of graceful swimming gait * Ready with eye and lip to
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    ensnare;
And like the tendril'd vine they loose * The rich profusion of
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    their hair:
Shooting their shafts and arrows from * Beautiful eyes beyond
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  compare;
Overpowering and transpiercing * Every froward adversaire.""
Sharrkan gazed upon the ten girls and saw in their midst a lady like the moon at fullest, with ringleted hair and forehead sheeny white, and eyes wondrous wide and black and bright, and temple locks like the scorpion's tail; and she was perfect in essence and attributes, as the poet said of her in these couplets,

""She beamed on my sight with a wondrous glance, * And her
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    straight slender stature enshamed the lance:
She burst on my sight with cheeks rosy red, * Where all manner of
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    beauties have habitance:
And the locks on her forehead were lowering as night * Whence
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    issues a dawn tide of happiest chance.""

Then Sharrkan heard her say to the handmaids, ""Come ye on, that I may wrestle with you and gravel you, ere the moon set and the dawn break!"" So each came up to her in turn and she grounded them forthright, and pinioned them with their girdles, and ceased not wrestling and pitching them until she had overthrown one and all. Then there turned to her an old woman who was before her, and the beldam said as in wrath, ""O strumpet, cost thou glory in grounding these girls? Behold I am an old woman, yet have I thrown them forty times! So what hast thou to boast of? But if thou have the strength to wrestle with me, stand up that I may grip thee and set thy head between thy heels!"" The young lady smiled at her words, but she was filled with inward wrath, and she jumped up and asked, ""O my lady Zat al-Dawahi,[FN#163] by the truth of the Messiah, wilt thou wrestle with me in very deed, or dost thou jest with me?""; and she answered, ""Yea,""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Forty-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the young lady asked Zat al-Dawahi, ""By the truth of the Messiah, wilt wrestle with me or dost jest?"", and she answered, ""Yea, I will wrestle with thee in very deed"" (Sharrkan looking on the while), the damsel cried, ""Rise up for the fall an thou have spunk so to do."" When the old woman heard this, she raged with exceeding rage, and her body hair stood on end like the bristles of a fretful hedgehog.[FN#164] Then she sprang to her feet, whilst the damsel stood up to her, and said, ""Now by the truth of the Messiah, I will not wrestle with thee unless I be naked, Mistress whore!""[FN#165] So she loosed her petticoat trousers and, putting her hand under her clothes, tore them off her body; then twisted up a silken kerchief into cord shape, girt it round her middle and became as she were a scald head If ritah or a spotted snake. With this she inclined towards the damsel and said, ""Do thou as I have done."" All this time, Sharrkan was gazing at the twain, and laughing at the beldam's loathly semblance. So the damsel leisurely rose and, taking a sash of Yamani stuff, passed it twice round her waist, then she tucked up her trousers and displayed two calves of alabaster carrying a mound of crystal, smooth and rounded, and a stomach which exhaled musk from its dimples, as it were a bed of Nu'uman's anemones; and breasts like double pomegranates. Then the old woman leant towards her, and the two laid hold either of each, while Sharrkan raised his head Heavenwards and prayed Allah that the belle might beat the beldam. Presently the young woman get beneath the old woman; and, gripping her waist cloth with the left and circling her neck with the right hand, hoisted her off the ground with both; whereupon the old woman strove to free herself and, in so doing fell on her back arsiversy, with her legs high in air and her hairy bush between them showed manifest in the moonshine; furthermore she let fly two great farts[FN#166] one of which blew up the dust from the earth's face and the other steamed up to the gate of Heaven. Sharrkan laughed till he fell back upon the ground. Then he arose and, baring his brand looked right and left, but he saw no one save the old woman sprawling on her back, and said to himself, ""He lied not who named thee Lady of Calamities! Verily thou knewest her prowess by her performance upon the others."" So he drew near them to hear what should pass between them. Then the young lady went up to the old one and, throwing a wrapper of thin silk upon her nakedness, helped her to don her clothes and made excuses saying, ""O my lady Zat al- Dawahi, I intended only to throw thee and not all this, but thou triedst to twist out of my hands; so laud to Allah for safety!"" She returned her no answer, but rose in her shame and walked away till out of sight, leaving the handmaids prostrate and pinioned, with the fair damsel standing amongst them. Quoth Sharrkan to himself, ""Every luck hath its cause. Sleep did not fall upon me nor the war horse bear me hither save for my good fortune; for doubtless this maid and what is with her shall become booty to me."" So he made towards his steed and mounted and heeled[FN#167] him on, when he sped as the shaft speeds from the bow and in his hand he still hent his brand bare of sheath, which he brandished shouting the while his war cry, ""Allah is All mighty[FN#168]!"" When the damsel saw him she sprang to her feet and, taking firm stand on the bank of the stream, whose breadth was six ells, the normal cubits, made one bound and landed clear on the farther side,[FN#169] where she turned and cried out with a loud voice, ""Who art thou, O thou fellow, that breakest in upon our privacy and pastime, and that too hanger in hand as if charging a host? Whence camest thou and whither art thou going? Speak sooth, for truth will stand thee in good stead, and lie not, for lies come of villein breed Doubtless thou hast wandered this night from thy way, that thou chancedst upon this place whence escape were the greatest of mercies; for thou art now in an open plain and, did we shout but a single shout, would come to our rescue four thousand knights.[FN#170] So tell me what thou wantest; and if thou wouldst only have us set thee on the right road, we will do so."" When Sharrkan heard her words he replied, ""I am a stranger of the Moslems, who fared forth this night single handed, seeking for spoil; nor could this moonlight show me a fairer booty than these ten maidens; so I shall seize them and rejoin my comrades with them."" Quoth she, ""I would have thee know that as for the booty thou hast not come at it; and, as for the handmaids, by Allah, they shall never be thy spoil. Have I not told thee that to lie is villein vile?"" Quoth he, ""The wise man is he who taketh warning by others."" Thereupon quoth she, ""By the truth of the Messiah, did I not fear that thy death would be on my hands, I would shout a shout should fill the mead for thee with war steeds and with men of might, but I take pity upon the stranger. So, if thou seek booty, I require of thee that thou alight from thy steed and swear to me, by thy faith, that thou wilt not advance against me aught like arms in hand, and we will wrestle, I and thou. If thou throw me, set me on thy steed and take all of us to thy booty; but if I throw thee, thou shalt become under my command. Swear this to me, for I fear thy treachery: indeed it hath become a common saw, 'Where Perfidy is innate there Trust is a weakly mate.' Now an thou wilt swear I will return and draw near to thee and tackle thee."" Answered Sharrkan (and indeed he lusted to seize her and said in his soul, ""Truly she knoweth not that I am a champion of champions""); ""Swear me by what oath thou wilt and by what thou deemest most binding, and I will not approach thee with aught till thou hast made thy preparation and sayest, 'Draw near that I wrestle with thee.' If thou throw me, I have money where withal to ransom myself; and if I throw thee, 'twill be booty and booty enough for me!"" Rejoined the damsel, ""I am content herewith!"" and Sharrkan was astounded at her words and said, ""And by the truth of the Apostle (whom Allah bless and keep!) I too am content on the other part!"" Then said she, ""Swear to me by Him who sprite in body dight and dealt laws to rule man kind aright, that thou wilt not offer me aught of violence save by way of wrestling; else mayst thou die without the pale of Al- Islam."" Sharrkan replied, ""By Allah! were a Kazi to swear me, even though he were a Kazi of the Kazis,[FN#171] he would not impose upon me such an oath as this!"" Then he sware to her by all she named and tied his steed to a tree; but he was drowned in the sea of thought, saying in himself, ""Praise be to Him who fashioned her from dirty water!""[FN#172] Then he girt himself and made ready for wrestling, and said to her, ""Cross the stream to me;"" but she replied, ""It is not for me to come over to thee: if thou wilt, pass thou over here to me."" ""I cannot do that,"" quoth he, and quoth she, ""O boy, I will come across to thee."" So she tucked up her skirts and, leaping, landed on the other side of the stream by his side; whereupon he drew near to her and bent him forwards and clapped palms.[FN#173] But he was confounded by her beauty and loveliness; for he saw a shape which the Hand of Power had tanned with the dye leaves of the Jann, which had been fostered by the Hand of Beneficence and fanned by the Zephyrs of fair fortune and whose birth a propitious ascendant had greeted. Then she called out to him, ""O Moslem, come on and let us wrestle ere the break of morning,"" and tucked up her sleeves from a forearm like fresh curd, which illumined the whole place with its whiteness; and Sharrkan was dazzled by it. Then he bent forwards and clapped his palms by way of challenge, she doing the like, and caught hold of her, and the two grappled and gripped and interlocked hands and arms. Presently he shifted his hands to her slender waist, when his finger tips sank into the soft folds of her middle, breeding languishment, and he fell a trembling like the Persian reed in the roaring gale. So she lifted him up and, throwing him to the ground, sat upon his breast with hips and hinder cheeks like mounds of sand, for his soul had lost mastery over his senses. Then she asked him, ""O Moslem! the slaying of Nazarenes is lawful to you folk; what then hast thou to say about being slain thyself?""; and he answered, ""O my lady, thy speech as regards slaying me is not other than unlawful; for our prophet Mohammed (whom Allah bless and preserve!) prohibited the slaying of women and children, old men and monks!"" ""As it was thus revealed to your Prophet,"" she replied, ""it behoveth us to render the equivalent of his mercy; so rise. I give thee thy life, for generosity is never lost upon the generous."" Then she got off his breast and he rose and stood shaking the dust from his head against the owners of the curved rib, even women; and she said to him, ""Be not ashamed; but verily one who entereth the land of Roum in quest of booty, and cometh to assist Kings against Kings, how happeneth it that he hath not strength enough to defend himself from one made out of the curved rib?"" ""'Twas not for lack of strength in me,"" he answered; ""nor didst thou throw me by thy force; it was thy loveliness overthrew me; so if thou wilt grant me another bout, it will be of thy courtesy."" She laughed and said, ""I grant thee thy request: but these handmaids have long been pinioned and their arms and sides are weary, and it were only right I should loose them, for haply this next wrestling bout will be long."" Then she went to the slave girls and, unbinding them, said to them in the tongue of Greece, ""Get ye to some safe place, till I foil this Moslem's lust and longing for you."" So they went away, whilst Sharrkan kept gazing at them and they kept turning to look at the two. Then each approached the adversary and he set his breast against hers, but when he felt waist touch waist, his strength failed him; and she, waxing ware of this, lifted him with her hands swiftlier than the blinding leven-flash, and threw him to the ground. He fell on his back,[FN#174] and then she said to him, ""Rise: I give thee thy life a second time. I spared thee in the first count because of thy Prophet, for that he made unlawful the slaying of women; and I do so on the second count because of thy weakliness and the greenness of thine years and thy strangerhood; but I charge thee, if there be in the Moslem army sent by Omar bin al-Nu'uman to succour the King of Constantinople, a stronger than thou, send him hither and tell him of me: for in wrestling there are shifts and trips, catches and holds, such as the feint or falsing and the snap or first grip, the hug, the feet-catch, the thigh Lite,[FN#175] the jostle and the leg-lock."" ""By Allah, O my lady,"" quoth Sharrkan (and indeed he was highly incensed against her), ""had I been Master al-Safd√≠, Master Mohammed Kim√°l or Ibn al-Sadd√≠,[FN#176] as they were in their prime, I had kept no note of these shifts thou mentionest; for O my mistress, by Allah, thou hast not grassed me by thy strength, but by the blandishments of thy back parts; for we men of Mesopotamia so love a full formed thigh that nor sense was left me nor foresight. But now, an thou wish, thou shalt try a third fall with me while my wits are about me, and this last match is allowed me by the laws of the game which sayeth the best of three: moreover I have regained my presence of mind."" When she heard his words she said to him, ""Hast thou not had a belly full of this wrestling, O vanquished one? However come on, an thou wilt; but know that this must be the last round."" Then she bent forward and challenged him and Sharrkan did likewise, setting to it in real earnest and being right cautious about the throw: so the two strove awhile and the damsel found in him a strength such as she had not observed before and said to him, ""O Moslem, thou art now on thy mettle."" ""Yes,"" he replied, ""thou knowest that there remaineth to me but this one round, after which each of us will wend a different way."" She laughed and he laughed too;[FN#177] then she overreached at his thigh and caught firm hold of it unawares, which made him greet the ground and fall full on his back. She laughed at him and said, ""Art thou an eater of bran? Thou are like a Badawi's bonnet which falleth off with every touch or else the Father of Winds[FN#178] that droppeth before a puff of air. Fie upon thee, O thou poor thing!"" adding, ""Get thee back to the Moslem army and send us other than thyself, for thou fairest of thews; and proclaim for us, among the Arabs and Persians, the Turks and Daylamites,[FN#179] whoso hath might in him, let him come to us."" Then she made a spring and landed on the other side of the stream and said to Sharrkan, laughing, ""Parting with thee is right grievous to me, O my lord; but get thee to thy mates before dawn, lest the Knights come upon thee and pick thee up on their lance points. Thou hast no strength to defend thee against a woman, so how couldst thou hold thine own amongst men of might and Knights?"" Sharrkan was confounded and called to her (as she turned from him making towards the convent), ""O my lady, wilt thou go away and leave the miserable stranger, the broken hearted slave of love?"" So she turned to him laughing and said, ""What is thy want? I will grant thee thy prayer."" ""Have I set foot in thy country and tasted the sweetness of thy courtesy,"" replied he, ""and shall I return without eating of thy victual and tasting thy hospitality; I who have become one of thy servitors!"" ""None baulk kindliness save the base,"" she rejoined, ""honour us in Allah's name, on my head and eyes be it! Mount thy steed and ride along the brink of the stream over against me, for now thou art my guest."" At this Sharrkan was glad and, hastening back to his horse, mounted and walked him abreast of her, and she kept faring on till they came to a drawbridge[FN#180] built of beams of the white poplar, hung by pullies and steel chains and made fast with hooks and padlocks. When Sharrkan looked, he saw awaiting her upon the bridge the same ten handmaids whom she had thrown in the wrestling bouts; and, as she came up to them, she said to one in the Greek tongue, ""Arise and take the reins of his horse and conduct him across into the convent."" So she went up to Sharrkan and led him over, much puzzled and perturbed with what he saw, and saying to himself, ""O would that the Wazir Dandan were here with me that his eyes might look upon these fairest of favours."" Then he turned to the young lady and said to her, ""O marvel of loveliness, now I have two claims upon thee; first the claim of good fellowship, and secondly for that thou hast carried me to thy home and offered me thy hospitality. I am now under thy commandance and thy guidance; so do me one last favour by accompanying me to the lands of Al-Islam; where thou shalt look upon many a lion hearted warrior and thou shalt learn who I am."" When she heard this she was angered and said to him, ""By the truth of the Messiah, thou hast proved thyself with me a man of keen wit; but now I see what mischief there is in thy heart, and how thou canst permit thyself a speech which proveth thy traitorous intent. How should I do as thou sayest, when I wot that if I came to that King of yours, Omar bin al- Nu'uman, I should never get free from him? For truly he hath not the like of me or behind his city walls or within his palace halls, Lord of Baghdad and of Khorasan though he be, who hath built for himself twelve pavilions, in number as the months of the year, and in each a concubine after the number of the days; and if I come to him he would not prove shy of me, for your folk believe I am lawful to have and to hold as is said in your writ, 'Or those women whom your right hand shall possess as slaves.'[FN#181] So how canst thou speak thus to me? As for thy saying, 'Thou shalt look upon the braves of the Moslems,' by the truth of the Messiah, thou sayest that which is not true, for I saw your army when it reached our land, these two days ago; and I did not see that your ordinance was the ordinance of Kings, but I beheld only a rabble of tribesmen gathered together. And as to thy words, 'Thou shalt know who I am,' I did not do thee kindness because of thy dignity but out of pride in myself; and the like of thee should not talk thus to the like of me, even wert thou Sharrkan, Omar bin al- Nu'uman's son, the prowess name in these days!"" ""Knowest thou Sharrkan?"" asked he; and she answered Yes! and I know of his coming with an army numbering ten thousand horsemen; also that he was sent by his sire with this force to gain prevalence for the King of Constantinople."" ""O my lady,"" said Sharrkan, ""I adjure thee by thy religion, tell me the cause of all this, that sooth may appear to me clear of untruth, and with whom the fault lies."" ""Now by the virtue of thy faith,"" she replied, ""did I not fear lest the news of me be bruited abroad that I am of the daughters of Roum, I would adventure myself and sally forth single handed against the ten thousand horsemen and slay their leader, the Wazir Dandan and vanquish their champion Sharrkan.[FN#182] Nor would aught of shame accrue to me thereby, for I have read books and studied the rules of good breeding in the language of the Arabs. But I have no need to vaunt my own prowess to thee, more by token as thou hast proved in thy proper person my skill and strength in wrestling; and thou hast learnt my superiority over other women. Nor, indeed, had Sharrkan himself been here this night and it were said to him, 'Clear this stream,' could he have done it; and I only long and lust that the Messiah would throw him into my hands in this very convent, that I might go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes.""- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Forty-eighth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Nazarene damsel said to Sharrkan (and he listening impatiently enow), ""Verily if Sharrkan fell into my hands, I would go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes,"" pride and passion and knightly jealousy took possession of him and he desired to discover and declare himself and to lay on load; but her loveliness restrained him and he began repeating,

""An faulty of one fault the Beauty prove, * Her charms a thousand advocates shall move.""

So she went up and Sharrkan after her; and, when he saw the maiden's back and hinder cheeks that clashed against each other, like rollers in the rolling sea, he extemporised these couplets:- -

""For her sins is a pleader that brow, * And all hearts its fair
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     pleading must bow:
When I saw it I cried, ""To night * The moon at its fullest doth
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    show;
Tho' Balkis' own Ifrit[FN#183] try a bout, * Spite his force she
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    would deal him a throw.""
The two fared on till they reached a gate over which rose a marble archway. This she opened and ushered Sharrkan into a long vestibule, vaulted with ten connected arches, from each of which hung a crystal lamp glistening like a spark of fire. The handmaids met her at the further end bearing wax candles of goodly perfume, and wearing on their heads golden fillets crusted with all manner bezel gems,[FN#184] and went on before her (Sharrkan still following), till they reached the inner convent. There the Moslem saw couches and sofas ranged all around, one opposite the other and all over hung with curtains flowered in gold. The monastery floor was paved with every kind of vari coloured marbles and mosaic work, and in the midst stood a basin that held four and twenty jetting fountains of gold, whence the water ran like molten silver; whilst at the upper end stood a throne spread with silks fit only for Kings. Then said the damsel, ""Ascend, O my lord, this throne."" So he went up to it and sat down and she withdrew to remain absent for some time. Sharrkan asked of her from one of the servants who answered him, ""She hath gone to her dormitory; but we will serve thee even as she ordered."" So they set before him viands of rare varieties, and he ate his sufficiency, when they brought him a basin of gold and an ewer of silver, and he washed his hands. Then his thoughts reverted to his army, knowing not what had befallen it in his absence and calling to mind also how he had forgotten his father's injunctions: so he was troubled about his case, repenting of what he had done till the dawn broke and the day appeared; when he lamented and sighed and became drowned in sea of sadness and repeated,

""I am not lost to prudence, but indeed * Here I'm bewildered,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    what shall be my rede?
Would any aid me in mine ails of love, * By my own might and
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    sleight would I be free'd:
But ah! my heart is lost and passion-shent: * To none save Allah
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  can I trust my need!""

When he ended his verse behold, there came up to him a rare show and a fair, more than twenty maidens like crescents encompassing the young lady, who shone in their midst as the full moon among the constellations guarding and girding her. She was clad in brocades befitting Kings; her breasts were like twin pomegranates, a woven zone set with all kinds of jewels tightly clasped her waist which expanded below into jutting hips; and her hinder cheeks stood out as a mound of crystal[FN#185] supporting a silvern shaft. When Sharrkan looked at her his wits went nigh to fly away from him with delight; and he forgot army and Wazir as he gazed on her fair head decked and dight with a net work of pearls set off by divers sorts of gems. Handmaids on her right and handmaids on her left bore her train, as she paced with dainty graceful gait in all the pride of seemlihead. He sprang to his feet seeing such beauty and loveliness, and cried aloud, ""Beware and beware of that zone rarely fair!"" and broke out into these couplets,

""With heavy back parts, high breasts delicate, * And lissome form
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   that sways with swimming gait
She deftly hides love longing in her breast; * But I may never
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   hide its ban and bate
While hosts of followers her steps precede,[FN#186] * Like pearls
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    now necklaced and now separate.""

She gazed upon him for a long time and considered him till she was assured of him, when she came up to him and said, ""In very sooth the place is honoured and illumined by thee, O Sharrkan! How sped thy night, O hero, after we went away and left thee?""; adding, ""Verily lying is a vile thing and a shameful, especially in great Kings! and thou art Crown Prince Sharrkan, son and heir of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; so henceforth make no secret of thy rank and condition, nor let me hear aught from thee but the truth; for leasing bequeatheth hate and despite. And as thou art pierced by the shaft of Fate, be resignation thine and abide content to wait."" When he heard her words he saw that artifice availed him naught and he acknowledged the truth, saying, ""I am Sharrkan, bin Omar bin al-Nu'uman, whom fortune hath afflicted and cast into this place; so whatso thou willest, do it in my case!"" She hung her head groundwards a long while, then turned to him and said, ""Be of good cheer and let thine eyes be cool and clear;[FN#187] for thou art the guest of my hospitality, and bread and salt hath made a tie between me and thee; wherefore thou art in my ward and under my safeguard. Have no fear for, by the truth of the Messiah, if all on earth sought to do thee hurt they should not come at thee, till life had left my body for thy sake: indeed thou art now under the charge of the Messiah and of me."" Hereat she sat her down by his side and fell to playing with him, till his alarm subsided and he knew that had she desired to slay him, she would have done so during the past night. Presently she bespoke in the Grecian tongue one of her slave girls, who went away and soon came back bringing a beaker and a tray of food; but Sharrkan abstained from eating and said to himself, ""Haply she hath put somewhat in this meat."" She knew what was in his thought; so she turned to him and said, ""By the truth of the Messiah, the case is not on such wise, nor is there aught in this meat of what thou suspectest! Had my mind been set on slaying thee, I had slain thee ere now."" Then she walked up to the tray and ate of every dish a mouthful; where upon Sharrkan came forward and ate too. She was pleased at this and both ate till they were satisfied. They washed their hands and after that she rose and ordered a handmaid to bring perfumes and herbs of sweet savour, wines of all colours and kinds and a wine-service with vessels of gold, silver and crystal. She filled a first goblet and drank it off before offering it to him, even as she had done with the food: then she crowned a second and handed it to him. He drank and she said to him, ""O Moslem, see how thou art here in all solace and delight of life!"" And she ceased not to drink and ply him with drink, till he took leave of his wits,- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day, and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Forty-ninth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the damsel ceased not to drink and ply Sharrkan with drink till he took leave of his wits, for the wine and the intoxication of love he bore her. Presently she said to the slave girl, ""O Marjanah[FN#188]! bring us some instruments of music!"" ""To hear is to obey,"" said the hand maid and going out, returned in the twinkling of an eye with a Damascus lute,[FN#189] a Persian harp, a Tartar pipe, and an Egyptian dulcimer. The young lady took the lute and, after tuning each several string, began in gentle undersong to sing, softer than zephyr's wing and sweeter than Tasmin[FN#190] spring, with heart safe and secure from everything the couplets following,

""Allah assain those eyne! What streams of blood they shed! * How
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   many an arrowy glance those lids of thine have sped.
I love all lovers who to lovers show them cure; * 'Twere wrong to
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   rue the love in wrong head born and bred:
Haply fall hapless eye for thee no sleeping kens! * Heaven help
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  the hapless heart by force of thee misled!
Thou doomest me to death who art my king, and I * Ransom with
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  life the deemster who would doom me dead.""
Thereupon each and every of the maidens rose up and taking an instrument, played and recited couplets in the Roumi tongue; then their mistress sang also and seeing Sharrkan in ecstasies asked him, ""O Moslem, dost thou understand what I say?""; and he answered, ""Nay, my ecstasy cometh from the beauty of thy finger sips."" She laughed and continued, ""If I sing to thee in Arabic what wouldst thou do?"" ""I should no longer,"" quoth he, ""be master of my senses."" Then she took an instrument and, changing the measure, began singing these verses,

""The smack of parting's myrrh to me, * How, then, bear patience'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    alo√´?
I'm girt by ills in trinity * Severance, distance,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     cruelty!
My freedom stole that fairest she, * And parting irks me
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    bitterly.""

When she ended her verse, she looked at Sharrkan and found him lost to existence, and he lay for a while stretched at full length and prone among the maidens.[FN#191] Then he revived and, remembering the songs, again inclined to mirth and merriment; and the twain returned to their wine and wassail, and continued their playing and toying, their pastime and pleasure till day ceased illuminating and night drooped her wing. Then the damsel went off to her dormitory and when Sharrkan asked after her they answered, ""She is gone to her sleeping chamber,"" whereto he rejoined, ""Under Allah's ward and His good guard!"" As soon as it was morning, a handmaid came to him and said to him, ""My mistress biddeth thee to her."" So he rose and followed her and, as he drew near her lodging, the damsels welcomed him with smitten tabrets and songs of greeting, and led him through a great door of ivory studded with pearls and jewels. Thence they passed with him into a tall and spacious hall, at the upper end of which was a wide dais carpeted with all kinds of silks, and round it open lattices commanding a view of trees and streams. About the saloon were figures carved in human form, and fashioned on such wise that the air passed through them and set in motion musical instruments within, so that the beholder would fancy they spoke.[FN#192] Here sat the young lady, looking at the figures; but when she saw Sharrkan, she sprang to her feet and, taking him by the hand, made him sit down by her side, and asked him how he had passed the night. He blessed her and the two sat talking awhile till she asked him, ""Knowest thou aught touching lovers and slaves of love?""; and he answered ""Yes! I wot somewhat in verse on that matter."" ""Let me hear it,"" quoth she, so he began quoting,

""Pleasure and health, good cheer, good appetite * To Azzah,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   freest with our name and fame!
By Allah! would I near her off she flies * At tangent, granting
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   less the more I claim:
I dote on Azzah, but when clear I off * My rivals, clears me too
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   that dearest dame;
Like wandering wight that chose for shade a cloud * Which, ere
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    siesta done, thin air became.""

When she heard this she said, ""Verily Al-Kuthayyir[FN#193] was conspicuous for sweet speech and chaste, and he was superlative in his praise of Azzah when he sang"" (and she began to recite),

""Did Azzah deal behest to Sun o' noon, * The judge had judged her
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     beauty's bestest boon;
And girls who come to me and carp at her, * God make their rosy
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   cheeks her sandal-shoon!

And indeed,"" quoth she, ""'twas said that Azzah boasted exceeding beauty and loveliness."" Then she asked Sharrkan saying, ""O Prince, cost thou know aught of Jamil's[FN#194] verses to Buthaynah? if so repeat to us somewhat of them;"" and he answered, ""Yes, I know them better than any;"" whereupon he began repeating these couplets,

""Jamil, in Holy war go fight!"" to me they say: * What war save
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    fight for fair ones would I e'er essay?
To me their every word and work are mere delight, * And martyrs
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   crepe I all they slay in fight and fray:
An ask I, 'O Buthaynah! what's this love, I pray, * Which eats
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    my heart?' quoth she ' 'Twill stay for ever and aye!'
And when I cry, 'Of wits return some small display * For daily
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    use,' quoth she, 'Far, far 'tis fled away!
Thou seekst my death; naught else thy will can satisfy * While I
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     no goal espy save thee and thee alway.'""

""Thou hast spoken right well,"" said she, ""O King's son, and Jamil also spoke excellently well. But what would Buthaynah have done with him that he saith in his hemistich,

'Thou seekst my death; naught else thy will can satisfy?'""

""O my lady,"" quoth Sharrkan, ""she willed to do him what thou willest to do with me, and even that will not satisfy thee."" She laughed at his opportune reply and they ceased not carousing till Day put out her light and Night came in darkness dight. Then she rose and went to her dormitory and slept, while Sharrkan slept in his place till morning dawned. As soon as he awoke, the hand maids came to him with tabrets and other instruments of mirth and merriment, as wont; and, kissing the ground between his hands, said to him, ""Bismillah! in Allah's name be so kind as to come[FN#195]: our mistress biddeth thee to her presence!"" So he rose and accompanied the slave girls who surrounded him, playing on tabrets and other instruments of music, till they passed from that saloon into another and a yet more spacious hall, decorated with pictured likenesses and figures of birds and beasts, passing all description. Sharrkan marvelled at the art and artifice of the place and began reciting,

""He plucks fruits of her necklace in rivalry, * And her breast-
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   pearls that bedded in gold mine lie.
Pure water on silvern bars is her brow, * And her cheeks show
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     roses with rubies vie:
Meseems in her eyne that the violet's hue * Lies purpling set in
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    the Ithmid's[FN#196] dye.""
When the lady saw Sharrkan, she stood up to him in honour and,
taking his hand, seated him by her side and asked, ""O son of King
Omar bin al-Nu'uman, hast thou any cunning in the game of chess?""
""Yes,"" he answered, ""but do not thou with me as said the poet,
'I speak and longing love upties me and unties me; * Till with
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     her honey dew of inner lip she plies me:
I brought the chess board and my liefest lover plays me * With
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    white and black,[FN#197] but black cum white ne'er satisfies
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     me:
'Twas as if King for Castle I were fain to place me * Till wilful
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     loss of game atwixt two queens surprise me:
And if I seek to read intent in eyes that eye me * Oh man! that
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     glance askance with hint of wish defies me.'""

Then she brought the chessboard and played with him; but Sharrkan, instead of looking at her moves, kept gazing at her fair mouth, and putting knight in place of elephant and elephant[FN#198] instead of knight. She laughed and said to him, ""If thy play be after this fashion, thou knowest naught of the game."" ""This is only our first,"" replied he, ""judge not by this bout."" When she beat him he replaced the pieces in position and played again with her; but she beat him a second time, a third, a fourth and a fifth. So she turned to him and said, ""Thou art beaten in everything;"" and he replied, ""O my lady, how should one playing with the like of thee avoid being beaten?"" Then she bade bring food, and they ate and washed their hands; after which the wine was set before them and they drank. Presently, she took the dulcimer, for her hand was cunning in smiting it, and she began repeating to an accompaniment these couplets,

""Twixt the close tied and open wide no medium Fortune knoweth, *
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    Now ebb and flow then flow and ebb this wise her likeness
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     showeth.
Then drink her wine the syne she's thine and smiling thou dost
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     find her * Anon she'll fall and fare away when all thy good
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     forth goeth.""

They ceased not to carouse till nightfall and this day was pleasanter even than the first. When darkness set in, the lady betook her to her dormitory, leaving him alone with the hand maids; so he threw himself on the ground and slept till dawn, when the damsels came to him with tambourines and other instruments according to custom. Seeing them he roused him hastily and sat up; and they carried him to their mistress, who came to meet him and, taking him by the hand, seated him by her side. Then she asked him how he had passed his night, whereat he prayed that her life be prolonged; and she took the lute and sang to it these verses which she improvised,

""Ne'er incline thee to part * Which embitters the heart
E'en the sun when he sets * Shall in pallor depart.""

While they were solacing themselves after this fashion, behold, there arose a great and sudden clamour, and a confused crowd of knights and men rushed in, holding drawn swords that glittered and gleamed in their hands, and cried aloud in the Grecian tongue ""Thou hast fallen into our hands, O Sharrkan, so make thee sure of death!"" When he heard this, he said to himself, ""By Allah, she hath entrapped me and held me in play, till her men should come. These are the Knights with whom she threatened me; but 'tis I who have thrown myself into this strait."" Then he turned towards the young lady to reproach her, but saw that she had changed colour and her face was pale; and she sprang to her feet and asked the crowd, ""Who are ye?"" ""O most gracious Princess and peerless onion pearl,"" answered the leading Knight, ""dost thou weet who is yon man by thy side?"" ""Not I,"" she replied, ""who may he be?"" Quoth the Patrician, ""This is of towns the highwayman! This is he who rideth in the horseman's van! This is Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman! This is he that forceth fortalice and penetrateth every impregnable place! The news of him reached King Hardub, thy father, by report of the ancient dame Zat al- Dawahi; and thy sire, our sovereign, hath made sure that thou hast rendered good service to the army of the Greeks by taking captive this ominous lion."" When she heard this, she looked at the Knight and asked him, ""What be thy name?"" and he answered, ""I am M√°s√∫rah, son of thy slave Maus√∫rah bin K√°shardah, Knight of Knights."" ""And how?"" quoth she, ""durst thou enter my presence without leave?"" Quoth he, ""O my lady, when I came to the gate, none forbade me, neither chamberlain nor porter, but all the door keepers rose and forewent us as of wont; although, when others come, they leave them standing at the gate while they ask permission to admit them. But this is not a time for long talking, when the King is expecting our return with this Prince, the scorpion sting[FN#199] of the Islamitic host, that he may kill him and drive back his men whither they came, without the bane of battling with them."" ""These words be ill words,"" rejoined the Princess, ""and Dame Zat al-Dawahi lied, avouching an idle thing and a vain, whereof she weeteth not the truth; for by the virtue of the Messiah, this man who is with me is not Sharrkan, nor is he a captive, but a stranger who came to us seeking our hospitality, and I made him my guest. So even were we assured that this be Sharrkan and were it proved to us that it is he beyond a doubt, I say it would ill befit mine honour that I should deliver into your hands one who hath entered under my protection. So make me not a traitor to my guest and a disgrace among men; but return to the King, my father, and kiss the ground before him, and inform him that the case is contrariwise to the report of the Lady Zat al-Dawahi."" ""O Abr√≠zah,"" replied Masurah, the Knight, ""I cannot return to the King's majesty without his debtor and enemy."" Quoth she (and indeed she had waxed very wroth). ""Out on thee! Return to him with my answer, and no blame shall befal thee!"" Quoth Masurah, ""I will not return without him."" Thereupon her colour changed and she exclaimed, ""Exceed not in talk and vain words; for verily this man had not come in to us, were he not assured that he could of himself and single handed make head against an hundred riders; and if I said to him, 'Thou art Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman,' he would answer, 'Yes.' But 'tis not of your competence to let or hinder him; for if you do so, he will not turn back from you till he hath slain all that are in this place. Behold, here he is by my side, and I will bring him before you sword and targe in hand."" ""Albeit I were safe from thy wrath,"" answered Masurah the Knight, ""I am not safe from that of thy father, and when I see him, I shall sign to the Knights to take him captive, and we will carry him to the King bound and in abject sort."" When she heard this, she said, ""The matter shall not pass thus, for 'twould be blazoning mere folly. This man is but one and ye are an hundred Knights: so if you would attack him come out against him, one after one, that it may appear to the King which is the valiant amongst you.""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Fiftieth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princess Abrizah said to the Knight, ""This man is but one, and ye are an hundred: so if ye would attack him, come out against him, one after one, that it may appear to the King which is the valiant."" Quoth Masurah, the Knight, ""By the truth of the Messiah, thou sayest sooth, and none but I shall sally out against him first."" Quoth she, ""Wait till I go to him and acquaint him with the case and hear what answer he will make. If he consent, 'tis well; but if he refuse, ye shall on no wise come to him, for I and my hand maids and whosoever is in the convent will be his ransom."" So she went to Sharrkan and told him the news, whereat he smiled and knew that she had not informed any of the Emirs; but that tidings of him had been bruited and blazed abroad, till the report reached the King, against her wish and intent. So he again began reproaching himself and said, ""How came I to adventure and play with my life by coming to the country of the Greeks?"" But hearing the young lady's proposal he said to her, ""Indeed their onset, one after one, would be overburdensome to them. Will they not come out against me, ten by ten?"" ""That would be villainy,"" said she; ""Let one have at one."" When he heard this, he sprang to his feet and made for them with his sword and battle gear; and Masurah, the Knight, also sprang up and bore down upon him. Sharrkan met him like a lion and delivered a shoulder cut[FN#200] which clove him to the middle, and the blade came out gleaming and glittering from his back and bowels. When the lady beheld that swashingblow, Sharrkan's might was magnified in her sight and she knew that when she overthrew him in the wrestle it was not by her strength but by her beauty and loveliness. So she turned to the Knights and said, ""Take wreak for your chief!"" Thereupon out came the slain man's brother, a fierce and furious Knight, and rushed upon Sharrkan, who delayed not, but smote him also with the shoulder cut and the sword came out glittering from his vitals. Then cried the Princess, ""O ye servants of the Messiah, avenge your comrade!"" So they ceased not charging down upon him, one after one; and Sharrkan also ceased not playing upon them with the blade, till he had slain fifty Knights, the lady looking on the while. And Allah cast a panic into the hearts of the survivors, so that they held back and dared not meet him in the duello, but fell upon him in a body; and he laid on load with heart firmer than a rock, and smote them and trod them down like straw under the threshing sled,[FN#201] till he had driven sense and soul out of them. Then the Princess called aloud to her damsels, saying, ""Who is left in the convent?""; and they replied, ""None but the gate keepers;"" whereupon she went up to Sharrkan and took him to her bosom, he doing the same, and they returned to the palace, after he had made an end of the melee. Now there remained a few of the Knights hiding from him in the cells of the monastery, and when the Princess saw this she rose from Sharrkan's side and left him for a while, but presently came back clad in closely meshed coat of ring mail and holding in her hand a fine Indian scymitar. And she said, ""Now by the truth of the Messiah, I will not be a niggard of myself for my guest; nor will I abandon him though for this I abide a reproach and a by word in the land of the Greeks."" Then she took reckoning of the dead and found that he had slain fourscore of the Knights, and other twenty had taken to flight.[FN#202] When she saw what work he had made with them she said to him, ""Allah bless thee, O Sharrkan! The Cavaliers may well glory in the like of thee."" Then he rose and wiping his blade clean of the blood of the slain began reciting these couplets,

""How oft in the mellay I've cleft the array, * And given their
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     bravest to lions a prey:
Ask of me and of them when I proved me prow * O'er creation, on
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     days of the foray and fray:
When I left in the onslaught their lions to lie * On the sands of
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     the low lands[FN#203] in fieriest day.""

When he ended his verse, the Princess came up to him with smiles and kissed his hand; then she doffed her hauberk and he said to her, ""O lady mine, wherefore didst thou don that coat of mail and bare thy brand?"" ""To guard thee against these caitiffs,""[FN#204] she replied. Then she summoned the gate keepers and asked them, ""How came ye to admit the King's Knights into my dwelling without leave of me?""; and they answered, ""O Princess, it is not our custom to ask leave of thee for the King's messengers, and especially for the chief of his Knights."" Quoth she, ""I think ye were minded only to disgrace me and murder my guest;"" and bade Sharrkan smite their necks. He did so and she cried to the rest of her servants, ""Of a truth, they deserved even more than that!"" Then turning to Sharrkan, she said to him, ""Now that there hath become manifest to thee what was concealed, thou shalt be made acquainted with my history. Know, then, that I am the daughter of King Hardub of Roum; my name is Abrizah and the ancient dame, yclept Zat al-Dawahi, is my grandmother by the sword side. She it certainly is who told my father of thee, and as surely she will compass a sleight to slay me, more by token as thou hast slain my father's chivalry and it is noised abroad that I have separated myself from the Nazarenes and have become no better than I should be with the Moslems. Wherefore it were wiser that I leave this dwelling while Zat al-Dawahi is on my track; but I require of thee the like kindness and courtesy I have shown thee, for enmity will presently befal between me and my father on thine account. So do not thou neglect to do aught that I shall say to thee, remembering all this betided me not save by reason of thee."" Hearing her words, Sharrkan joyed greatly; his breast broadened and his wits flew from him for delight, and he said, ""By Allah, none shall come at thee, while life is in my bosom! But hast thou patience to bear parting from thy parents and thy people?"" ""Even so,"" she answered; and Sharrkan swore to her and the two plighted their troth. Then said she, ""Now is my heart at ease; but there remaineth one other condition for thee."" ""What is it?"" asked he and she answered, ""It is that thou return with thy host to thine own country."" Quoth he, ""O lady mine, my father, King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, sent me to wage war upon thy sire, on account of the treasure he plundered from the King of Constantinople, and amongst the rest three great jewels, noted givers of good fortune."" Quoth she, ""Cheer thy heart and clear thine eyes: I will tell thee the whole of the tale and the cause of our feud with the King of Constantinople. Know that we have a yearly festival, highs the Convent Feast, whereat Kings from all quarters and the noblest women are wont to congregate; thither also come merchants and traders with their wives and families, and the visitors abide there seven days. I was wont to be one of them; but, when there befel enmity between us, my father forbade me to be present at the festival for the space of seven years. One year, it chanced that amongst the daughters of the great who resorted to the patron, as was their custom, came a daughter of the King of Constantinople, a beautiful girl called Sophia. They tarried at the monastery six days and on the seventh the folk went their ways;[FN#205] but Sophia said, 'I will not return to Constantinople save by water.' So they equipped for her a ship in which she embarked with her suite; and making sail they put out to sea; but as they were voyaging behold, a contrary wind caught them and drove the vessel from her course till, as Fate and Fortune would have it, she fell in with a Nazarene craft from the Camphor Island[FN#206] carrying a crew of five hundred armed Franks, who had been cruising about a long time. When they sighted the sails of the ship, wherein Sophia and her women were, they gave chase in all haste and in less than an hour they came up with her, then they laid the grappling irons aboard her and captured her. Then taking her in tow they made all sail for their own island and were but a little distant from it when the wind veered round and, splitting their sails, drove them on to a shoal which lies off our coast. Thereupon we sallied forth and, looking on them as spoil driven to us by Fate,[FN#207] boarded and took them; and, slaying the men, made prize of the wreck, wherein we found the treasures and rarities in question and forty maidens, amongst whom was the King's daughter, Sophia. After the capture we carried the Princess and her women to my father, not knowing her to be a daughter of King Afridun of Constantinople; and he chose out for himself ten including her; and divided the rest among his dependents. Presently he set apart five damsels, amongst whom was the King s daughter, and sent them to thy father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, together with other gifts, such as broadcloth[FN#208] and woollen stuffs and Grecian silks. Thy father accepted them and chose out from amongst the five girls Sophia, daughter of King Afridun; nor did we hear more of her till the beginning of this year, when her father wrote to my father in words unfitting for me to repeat, rebuking him with menaces and saying to him: Two years ago, you plundered a ship of ours which had been seized by a band of Frankish pirates in which was my daughter, Sophia, attended by her maidens numbering some threescore. Yet ye informed me not thereof by messenger or otherwise; nor could I make the matter public, lest reproach befal me amongst the Kings, by reason of my daughter's honour. So I concealed my case till this year, when I wrote to certain Frankish corsairs and sought news of my daughter from the Kings of the Isles. They replied, 'By Allah we carried her not forth of thy realm; but we have heard that King Hardub rescued her from certain pirates. And they told me the whole tale.' Then he added in the writing which he writ to my father: 'Except you wish to be at feud with me and design to disgrace me and dishonour my daughter, you will, the instant my letter reacheth you, send my daughter back to me. But if you slight my letter and disobey my commandment, I will assuredly make you full return for your foul dealing and the baseness of your practices.'[FN#209] When my father read this letter and understood the contents,[FN#210] it vexed him and he regretted not having known that Sophia, King Afridun's daughter, was among the captured damsels, that he might have sent her back to her sire; and he was perplexed about the case because, after so long a time, he could not send to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and demand her back from him, especially as he had lately heard that Heaven had granted him boon of babe by this Sophia. So when we pondered that truth, we knew that this letter was none other than a grievous calamity; and my father found nothing for it but to write an answer to King Afridun, making his excuses and swearing to him by strong oaths that he knew not his daughter to be among the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth how he had sent her to King Omar bin al Nu'uman, who had gotten the blessing of issue by her. When my father's reply reached King Afridun he rose up and sat down,[FN#211] and roared and foamed at the mouth crying:‚Äî'What! shall he take captive my daughter and even her with slave girls and pass her on from hand to hand sending her for a gift to Kings, and they lie with her without marriage contract? By the Messiah and the true Faith,' said he, 'I will not desist till I have taken my blood vengeance for this and have wiped out my shame; and indeed I will do a deed which the chroniclers shall chronicle after me!' So he bided his time till he devised a device and laid notable toils and snares, when he sent an embassy to thy father, King Omar, to tell him that which thou hast heard: accordingly thy father equipped thee and an army with thee and sent thee to King Afridun, whose object is to seize thee and thine army to boot. As for the three jewels whereof he told thy father when asking his aid, there was not one soothfast word in that matter, for they were with Sophia, his daughter; and my father took them from her, when he got possession of her and of her maidens, and gave them to me in free gift, and they are now with me. So go thou to thy host and turn them back ere they be led deep into, and shut in by, the land of the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth the Franks and the country of the Greeks; for as soon as you have come far enough into their interior, they will stop the roads upon you and there will be no escape for you till the Day of retribution and retaliation. I know that thy troops are still halting where thou leftest them, because thou didst order a three days' rest; withal they have missed thee all this time and they wot not what to do."" When Sharrkan heard her words, he was absent awhile in thought; then he kissed Princess Abrizah's hand and said, ""Praise be to Allah who hath bestowed thee on me and appointed thee to be the cause of my salvation and the salvation of whoso is with me! But 'tis grievous to me to part from thee and I know not what will become of thee after my departure."" ""Go now to thine army,"" she replied, ""and turn them back, while ye are yet near your own country. If the envoys be still with them, lay hands on them and keep them, that the case may be made manifest to you; and, after three days, I will be with you all and we will enter Baghdad together."" As he turned to depart she said, ""Forget not the compact which is between me and thee,"" then she rose to bid[FN#212] him farewell and embrace him and quench the fire of desire, so she took leave of him and, throwing her arms round his neck, wept with exceeding weeping, and repeated these verses,

""I bade adieu, my right hand wiped my tears away, * The while my
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     left hand held her in a close embrace:
'Fearest thou naught,' quoth she, 'of shame?' I answered 'Nay, *
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     The lover's parting day is lover's worst disgrace.'""

Then Sharrkan left her and walked down from the convent. They brought his steed, so he mounted and rode down stream to the drawbridge which he crossed and presently threaded the woodland paths and passed into the open meadow. As soon as he was clear of the trees he was aware of horsemen which made him stand on the alert, and he bared his brand and rode cautiously, but as they drew near and exchanged curious looks he recognized them and behold, it was the Wazir Dandan and two of his Emirs. When they saw him and knew him, they dismounted and saluting him, asked the reason of his absence; whereupon he told them all that had passed between him and Princess Abrizah from first to last. The Wazir returned thanks to Almighty Allah for his safety and said,[FN#213] ""Let us at once leave these lands; for the envoys who came with us are gone to inform the King of our approach, and haply he will hasten to fall on us and take us prisoners."" So Sharrkan cried to his men to saddle and mount, which they did and, setting out at once, they stinted not faring till they reached the sole of the valley wherein the host lay. The Ambassadors meanwhile had reported Sharrkan's approach to their King, who forthright equipped a host to lay hold of him and those with him. But Sharrkan, escorted by the Wazir Dandan and the two Emirs, had no sooner sighted the army, than he raised the cry ""March! March!"" They took horse on the instant and fared through the first day and second and third day, nor did they cease faring for five days; at the end of which time they alighted in a well wooded valley, where they rested awhile. Then they again set out and stayed not riding for five and twenty days which placed them on the frontiers of their own country. Here, deeming themselves safe, they halted to rest; and the country people came out to them with guest gifts for the men and provender and forage for the beasts. They tarried there two days after which, as all would be making for their homes, Sharrkan put the Wazir Dandan in command, bidding him lead the host back to Baghdad. But he himself remained behind with an hundred riders, till the rest of the army had made one day's march: then he called ""To horse!"" and mounted with his hundred men. They rode on two parasangs'[FN#214] space till they arrived at a gorge between two mountains and lo! there arose before them a dark cloud of sand and dust. So they checked their steeds awhile till the dust opened and lifted, discovering beneath it an hundred cavaliers, lion faced and in mail coats cased. As soon as they drew within earshot of Sharrkan and his meiny they cried out to them, saying, ""By the virtue of John and Mary, we have won to our wish! We have been following you by forced marches, night and day, till we forewent you to this place. So dismount and lay down your arms and yield yourselves, that we may grant you your lives."" When Sharrkan heard this, his eyes stood out from his head and his cheeks flushed red and he said 'How is it, O. Nazarene dogs, ye dare enter our country and overmatch our land? And doth not this suffice you, but ye must adventure yourselves and address us in such unseemly speech? Do you think to escape out of our hands and return to your country?"" Then he shouted to his hundred horsemen, ""Up and at these hounds, for they even you in number!"" So saying, he bared his sabre and bore down on them, he and his, but the Franks met them with hearts firmer than rocks, and wight dashed against wight, and knight dashed upon knight, and hot waxed the fight, and sore was the affright, and nor parley nor cries of quarter helped their plight; and they stinted not to charge and to smite, right hand meeting right, nor to hack and hew with blades bright white, till day turned to night and gloom oppressed the sight. Then they drew apart and Sharrkan mustered his men and found none wounded save four only, who showed hurts but not death hurts. Said he to them, ""By Allah, my life long have I waded in the clashing sea of fight and I have met many a gallant sprite, but none so unfrightened of the sword that smites and the shock of men that affrights like these valiant Knights!"" ""Know, O King,"" said they, that there is among them a Frankish cavalier who is their leader and, indeed, he is a man of valour and fatal is his spear thrust: but, by Allah, he spares us great and small; for whoso falls into his hands he lets him go and forbears to slay him. By Allah, had he willed he had killed us all."" Sharrkan was astounded when he heard what the Knight had done and such high report of him, so he said, ""When the morn shall morrow, we will draw out and defy them, for we are an hundred to their hundred; and we will seek aid against them from the Lord of the Heavens."" So they rested that night in such intent; whilst the Franks gathered round their Captain and said, ""Verily this day we did not win our will of these;"" and he replied, ""At early dawn when the morrow shall morn, we will draw out and challenge them, one after one."" They also rested in that mind, and both camps kept guard until Almighty Allah sent the light of day dawn. Thereupon King Sharrkan and his hundred riders took horse and rode forth to the plain, where they found the Franks ranged in line of battle; and Sharrkan said to his followers, ""Our foes have determined like ourselves to do their devoir; so up and at them and lay on load."" Then came forth an Herald of the Franks and cried out, saying, ""Let there be no general engagement betwixt us this day, save by the duello, a champion of yours against a champion of ours."" Whereupon one of Sharrkan's riders dashed out from the ranks and crave between the two lines crying, ""Ho! who is for smiting? Let no dastard engage me this day nor niderling!"" Hardly had he made an end of his vaunt, when there sallied forth to him a Frankish cavalier, armed cap-√†-pie and clad in a surcoat of gold stuff, riding on a grey white steed,[FN#215] and he had no hair on his cheeks. He urged his charger on to the midst of the battle plain and the two fell to derring do of cut and thrust, but it was not long before the Frank foined the Moslem with the lance point; and, toppling him from his steed, took him prisoner and led him off crestfallen. His folk rejoiced in their comrade and, forbidding him to go out again to the field, sent forth another, to whom sallied out another Moslem, brother to the captive, and offered him battle. The two fell to, either against other, and fought for a little while, till the Frank bore down upon the Moslem and, falsing him with a feint, tumbled him by a thrust of the lance heel from his destrier and took him prisoner. After this fashion the Moslems ceased not dashing forwards, one after one, and the Franks to unhorse them and take them captive, till day departed and the night with darkness upstarted. Now they had captured of the Moslems twenty cavaliers, and when Sharrken saw this, it was grievous to him and he mustered his men and said to them, ""What is this thing that hath befallen us? To- morrow, I myself will go forth to the field and offer singular combat to their chief and learn what is the cause of his entering our land and warn him against doing battle with our band. If he persist, we will punish him with death, and if he prove peaceable we will make peace with him."" They righted on this wise till Allah Almighty caused the morn to dawn, when mounted the twain and drew up for battle fain; and Sharrkan was going forth to the plain, but behold, more than one half of the Franks dismounted and remained on foot before one of them who was mounted, till they reached the midst of the battle plain. Sharrken looked at that horseman and lo! he was their chief. He was clad in a surcoat of blue satin and a close ringed mail shirt; his face was as the moon when it rises and no hair was upon his cheeks. He hent in hand an Indian scymitar and he rode a sable steed with a white blaze on brow, like a dirham; and he smote the horse with heel till he stood almost in the midst of the field when, signing to the Moslems, he cried out in fluent Arab speech ""Ho, Sharrkan! Ho, son of Omar bin al- Nu'uman! Ho, thou who forcest fortalice and overthrowest cities and countries! up and out to battle bout, and blade single handed wield with one who halves with thee the field! Thou art Prince of thy people and I am Prince of mine; and whoso overcometh his adversary, him let the other's men obey and come under his sway."" Hardly had he ended his speech, when out came Sharrkan with a heart full of fury, and urging his steed into the midst of the field, closed like a raging lion with the Frank who encountered him with wariness and steadfastness and met him with the meeting of warriors. Then they fell to foining and hewing, and they stinted not of onset and offset, and give and take, as they were two mountains clashing together or two seas together dashing; nor did they cease fighting until day darkened and night starkened. Then they drew apart and each returned to his own party; but as soon as Sharrkan foregathered with his comrades, he said, ""Never looked I on the like of this cavalier: he hath one quality I have not yet seen in any and this it is that, when his foemen uncovereth a place for the death blow, he reverseth his weapon and smiteth with the lance-heel! In very deed I know not what will be the issue 'twixt him and me; but 'tis my wish that we had in our host his like and the like of his men."" Then he went to his rest for the night and, when morning dawned, the Frank came forth and rode down to the mid field, where Sharrkan met him; and they fell to fighting and to wheeling, left and right; and necks were stretched out to see the sight, nor did they stint from strife and sword play and lunge of lance with main and might, till the day turned to night and darkness overwhelmed the light. Then the twain drew asunder and returned each to his own camp, where both related to their comrades what had befallen them in the duello; and at last the Frank said to his men, ""Tomorrow shall decide the matter!"" So they both passed that night restfully till dawn; and, as soon as it was day, they mounted and each bore down on other and ceased not to fight till half the day was done. Then the Frank bethought him of a ruse; first urging his steed with heel and then checking him with the rein, so that he stumbled and fell with his rider; thereupon Sharrkan threw himself on the foe, and would have smitten him with the sword fearing lest the strife be prolonged, when the Frank cried out to him, ""O Sharrkan, champions are not wont to do thus! This is the act of a man accustomed to be beaten by a woman.""[FN#216] When Sharrkan heard this, he raised his eyes to the Frank's face and gazing steadfastly at him, recognized in him Princess Abrizah with whom that pleasant adventure had befallen him in the convent; whereupon he cast brand from hand and, kissing the earth before her, asked her, ""What moved thee to a deed like this?""; and she answered, ""I desired to prove thy prowess afield and test thy doughtiness in tilting and jousting. These that are with me are my handmaids, and they are all clean maids; yet they have vanquished thy horsemen in fair press and stress of plain; and had not my steed stumbled with me, thou shouldst have seen my might and prowess in combat."" Sharrkan smiled at her speech and said, ""Praise be to Allah for safety and for my reunion with thee, O Queen of the age!"" Then she cried out to her damsels to loose the twenty captives of Sharrkan's troop and dismount. They did as she bade and came and kissed the earth before her and Sharrkan who said to them, ""It is the like of you that Kings keep in store for the need hour."" Then he signed to his comrades to salute the Princess; so all alighted and kissed the earth before her, for they knew the story. After this, the whole two hundred took horse, and fared on night and day for six days' space, till they drew near to Baghdad, when they halted and Sharrkan bade Abrizah and her handmaids doff the Frankish garb that was on them,‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Fifty-first Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan bade Princess Abrizah and her damsels doff the garb that was on them and don the garments of daughters of Greece; and thus did they. Then he despatched a company of his companions to Baghdad to acquaint his father Omar bin al-Nu'uman, with his arrival and report that he was accompanied by Princess Abrizah, daughter of King Hardub, Lord of Graecia-land. They halted forthright in the place they had reached, and Sharrkan also halted and all righted there; and when Almighty Allah made morning dawn, Sharrkan and his company and Abrizah and her company took horse and fared on towards the city; when lo! on the way they met the Wazir Dandan, who had come out amongst a thousand horse to honour Abrizah and Sharrkan, by especial commandment of King Omar Son of Al- Nu'uman. When the two drew near, they turned towards them and kissed ground before them; then they mounted again and escorted them into the city and went up with them to the palace. Sharrkan walked in to his father, who rose and embraced him and questioned him of his case. So he told him all that Abrizah had told him, and what had passed between them and said, ""She hath parted from her sire and departed from her reign and hath chosen to take part with us and make her abode with us; and indeed,"" he said to his father, ""the King of Constantinople hath plotted to do us a mischief, because of his daughter Sophia, for that the King of Greece had made known to him her story and the cause of her being given to thee; and he (the Grecian King) not knowing her to be daughter of King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople; and, had he known that, he would not have bestowed her upon thee, but he would have restored her to her parent. And of a verity,"" he continued, ""we were saved from these perils only by the Lady Abrizah, and never saw we a more valiant than she."" And he went on to tell his father all that had passed from first to last of the wrestling and the single fighting. When King Omar heard the story of Sharrkan, Abrizah was exalted in his eyes, and he longed to see her and question her. Thereupon Sharrkan went out to her and said, ""The King calleth for thee;"" she replied, ""I hear and I obey;"" and he took her and brought her in to his father, who was seated on his throne and who, having dismissed his high officers, was attended only by his eunuchs. The Princess entered and kissing the ground between his hands, saluted him in choice terms. He was amazed at her eloquent speech and thanked her for her dealing with his son Sharrkan and bade her be seated. So she sat down and unveiled her face;[FN#217] and, when the King saw her beauty, his reason fled his head and he made her draw near and showed her favour, appointing her an especial palace for herself and her damsels, and assigning them solde and allowances. Then began he to ask her of the three jewels aforesaid, and she answered, ""Here be they with me, O King of the age!"" So saying, she rose and going to her lodging, unpacked her baggage and from it brought out a box and from the box a casket of gold. She opened the casket and taking out those three jewels, kissed them and gave them to the King. Then she went away bearing his heart with her. After her going the King sent for his son Sharrkan and gave him one jewel of the three, and when he enquired of the other two replied, ""O my son! I mean to give one to thy brother Zau al-Makan, and the other to thy sister Nuzhat al- Zaman."" But when Sharrkan heard that he had a brother (for to that time he knew only of his sister) he turned to his sire and said to him, ""O King, hast thou a son other than myself?"" He answered, ""Yes, and he is now six years old;"" adding that his name was Zau al- Makan and that he and Nuzhat al-Zaman were twins, born at a birth. This news was grievous to Sharrkan, but he kept his secret and said, ""The bless- ing of Allah Most High be upon them!"", and he cast the jewel from his hand and shook the dust off his clothes. Quoth the King, ""How do I see thee change thy manner when hearing of this, considering that after me thou becomes"" heir of the kingdom. Of a truth the troops have sworn to thee and the Emirs and Grandees have taken the oath of succession to thee; and this one of the three jewels is thine."" Sharrkan bowed his head to the ground and was ashamed to bandy words with his parent so he accepted the jewel and went away, knowing not what to do for exceeding wrath, and stayed not walking till he had entered Abrizah's palace. As he approached she stood up to meet him and thanked him for what he had done and prayed for blessings on him and his sire. Then she sat down and seated him by her side; but when he had taken his place she saw rage in his face and questioned him, whereupon he told her that Allah had blessed his father with two children by Sophia, a boy and a girl, and that he had named the boy Zau al-Makan and the girl Nuzhat al-Zaman; adding, ""He hath kept the other two jewels for them and hath given me one of thine, so I left it behind; I knew naught of Zau al-Makan's birth till this day, and the twain are now six years old. So when I learnt this, wrath possessed me; and I tell thee the reason of my rage and hide nothing from thee. But now I fear lest my father take thee to wife, for he loveth thee and I saw in him signs of desire for thee: so what wilt thou say, if he wish this?"" Quoth she, ""Know, O Sharrkan, that thy father hath no dominion over me, nor can he have me without my consent; and if he prevail over me by force, I will take my own life. As for the three jewels, it was not my intent that he should give any of them to either of his children and I had no thought but that he would lay them up in his treasury with his things of price; but now I desire of thy favour that thou make me a present of the jewel which he gave thee, if thou have accepted it."" ""Hearkening and obedience,"" replied Sharrkan, and gave it to her. Then said she, ""Fear nothing,"" and talked with him awhile and continued, ""I fear lest my father hear that I am with you and sit not patiently under my loss, but do his endeavours to find me; and to that end he may ally himself with King Afridun, on account of his daughter Sophia, and both come on thee with armies and so there befal great turmoil."" When Sharrken heard these words, he said to her, ""O my lady, if it please thee to sojourn with us, take no thought of them; though there gather together against us all that be on land and on sea."" "" 'Tis well,"" rejoined she; ""if ye entreat me fair, I will tarry with you, and if ye deal evilly by me, I will depart from you."" Then she bade her slave maidens bring food; so they set the tables, and Sharrkan ate a little and went away to his own house, disturbed and perturbed. Such was his case; but regarding the affairs of his father, Omar bin al-Nu'uman, after dismissing his son Sharrkan he arose and, taking the other two jewels, betook himself to the Lady Sophia, who stood up when she saw him and remained standing till he was seated. Presently, his two children, Zau al-Makan and Nuzhat al-Zaman, came to him and he kissed them and hung a jewel round each one's neck, at which they rejoiced and kissed his hands. Then went they to their mother, who joyed in their joy and wished the King long life; so he asked her, ""Why hast thou not informed me all this time that thou art the daughter of King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, that I might have honoured thee still more and enlarged thee in dignity and raised thy rank?"" ""O King,"" answered Sophia, ""and what could I desire greater or higher than this my standing with thee, overwhelmed as I am with thy favours and thy benefits? And, furthermore, Allah hath blessed me with two children by thee, a son and a daughter."" Her reply pleased the King and after leaving her, he set apart for her and her children a wondrous fine palace. Moreover, he appointed for them eunuchs and attendants and doctors of law and doctors of philosophy and astrologers and physicians and surgeons to do them service; and in every way he redoubled his favour and entreated them with the best of treatment. And presently he returned to the palace of his dominion and to his Court where he distributed justice among the lieges. So far concerning him and Sophia and her children; but in the matter of Abrizah the King was greatly occupied with love of her and burnt with desire of her night and day; and every night, he would go in to her and converse with her and pay his court to her, but she gave him no answer, only saying, ""O King of the age! I have no desire for men at this present."" When he saw her withdraw from him, his passion waxed hotter and his longing and pining increased until, when weary of this, he summoned his Wazir Dandan and, opening his very heart to him, told him of his love for Princess Abrizah, daughter of Hardub, and informed him how she refused to yield to his wishes and how desire for her was doing him to die, for that he could get no grace of her. The Wazir, hearing these words, said to the King, ""As soon as it is dark night, take thou a piece of Bhang the measure of a miskal, about an ounce, and go in to her and drink somewhat of wine with her. When the hour of ending the carousel shall draw near, fill her a last cup and dropping therein the Bhang, give it to her to drink, and she will not reach her sleeping chamber ere the drug take effect on her. Then do thou go in to her and take thy will of her; and such is my advice.""[FN#218] ""Thy rede is aright,"" quoth the King, and seeking his treasury, he took thence a piece of concentrated Bhang, if an elephant smelt it he would sleep from year to year. This he put in his bosom pocket and waited till some little of the night went by, when he betook himself to the palace of Princess Abrizah, who seeing him stood up to receive him; but he bade her sit down. So she sat down, and he sat by her, and he began to talk with her of wine and wassail, whereupon she furnished the carousing table[FN#219] and placed it before him. Then she set on the drinking vessels and lighted the candles and ordered to bring dried fruits and sweet meats and all that pertaineth to drinking. So they fell to tippling and the King ceased not to pledge her till drunkenness crept into her head; and seeing this he took out the bit of Bhang from his pocket and, holding it between his fingers, filled a cup with his own hand and drank it off. Then filling a second he said, ""To thy companionship!""; and dropped the drug into her cup, she knowing naught of it. She took it and drank it off; then she rose and went to her sleeping chamber. He waited for less than an hour till he was assured that the dose had taken effect on her and had robbed her of her senses, when he went in to her and found her thrown on her back: and she had doffed her petticoat trousers and the air raised the skirt of her shift and discovered what was between her thighs. When the King saw the state of things and found a lighted candle at her head and another at her feet, shining upon what her thighs enshrined he took leave of his five senses for lust and Satan seduced him and he could not master himself, but put off his trousers and fell upon her and abated her maiden head. Then he rose off her and went to one of her women, by name Marj√°nah, and said, ""Go in to thy lady and speak with her."" So she went in to her mistress and found her lying on her back insensible, with the blood running down to the calves of her legs, whereupon she took a kerchief and wiped away the blood and lay by her that night. As soon as Almighty Allah brought the dawn, the handmaid Marjanah washed her mistress's hands and feet and brought rose water and bathed her face and mouth with it, where upon she sneezed and yawned and cast up from her inside that bit of Bhang like a bolus.[FN#220] Then she revived and washed her hands and mouth and said to Marjanah, ""Tell me what hath befallen me."" So she told her what had passed and how she had found her, lying on her back, with the blood running down, wherefore she knew that King Omar bin al-Nu'uman had lain with her and had undone her and taken his will of her. At this she grieved with exceeding grief and retired into privacy, saying to her damsels, ""Deny me to whoso would come in to me and say to him that I am ill, till I see what Allah will do with me."" Presently the news of her sickness came to the King; so he sent her sherbets and sugar electuaries. Some months she thus passed in solitude, during which time the King's flame cooled and his desire for her was quenched, so that he abstained from her. Now she had conceived by him, and when the months of child breeding had gone by, her pregnancy appeared and her belly swelled, and the world was straitened upon her, so she said to her handmaid Marjanah, ""Know that it is not the folk who have wronged me, but I who sinned against my own self[FN#221] in that I left my father and mother and country. Indeed, I abhor life, for my spirit is broken and neither courage nor strength is left me. I used, when I mounted my steed, to have the mastery of him, but now I am unable to ride. If I be brought to bed among them I shall be dishonoured before my hand women and every one in the palace will know that he hath taken my maidenhead in the way of shame; and if I return to my father, with what face shall I meet him or with what face shall I have recourse to him? How well quoth the poet,

'Say, what shall solace one who hath nor home nor stable stead *
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     Nor cup companion, nor a cup, nor place to house his head?'""

Marjanah answered her, ""It is thine to command; I will obey;"" and Abrizah said, ""I desire at once to leave this place secretly, so that none shall know of me but thou; and return to my father and my mother, for when flesh stinketh, there is naught for it but its own folk and Allah shall do with me e'en as He will."" ""O Princess,"" Marjanah replied, ""what thou wouldest do is well."" Then she made matters ready and kept her secret and waited for some days till the King went out to chase and hunt, and his son Sharrkan betook himself to certain of the fortresses to sojourn there awhile. Then said she to Marjanah, ""I wish to set out this night, but how shall I do against my destiny? For already I feel the pangs of labour and child birth, and if I abide other four or five days, I shall be brought to bed here, and I shall be unable to travel to my country. But this is what was written on my forehead."" Then she considered awhile, and said to Marjanah, ""Look us out a man who will go with us and serve us by the way, for I have no strength to bear arms."" ""By Allah, O my lady,"" replied Marjanah, ""I know none but a black slave called Al- Ghazb√°n,[FN#222] who is one of the slaves of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman; he is a valiant wight, and he keepeth guard at our palace gate. The King appointed him to attend us, and indeed we have overwhelmed him with our favours; so, lookye, I will go out and speak with him of this matter, and promise him some monies and tell him that, if he have a mind to tarry with us, I will marry him to whom he will. He told me before to day that he had been a highwayman; so if he consent to us we shall win our wish and reach to our own land."" She rejoined, ""Call him that I may talk with him;"" whereupon Marjanah fared forth and said to the slave, 'O Ghazban, Allah prosper thee, so thou fall in with what my lady saith to thee!"" Then she took him by the hand and brought him to the Princess, whose hands he kissed but as she beheld him, her heart took fright at him. ""How ever,"" she said to herself, ""of a truth, Need giveth the law;"" and she approached to speak with him, yet her heart started away from him. Presently she said, ""O Ghazban, say me, wilt thou help me against the perfidies of Fortune and conceal my secret if I discover it to thee?"" When the slave saw her, his heart was taken by storm and he fell in love with her forthright and could not but reply; ""O my mistress, whatsoever thou biddest me do, I will not depart therefrom."" Quoth she, ""I would have thee take me at this hour and take this my handmaid and saddle us two camels and two of the King's horses and set on each horse a saddle bag of goods and somewhat of provaunt, and go with us to our own country; where, if thou desire to abide with us, I will marry thee to her thou shalt choose of my handmaidens, or, if thou prefer return to thine own land, we will marry thee and give thee whatso thou desires"" after thou hast taken of money what shall satisfy thee."" When Al Ghazban, heard this, he rejoiced with great joy and replied, ""O my lady, I will serve both of you with mine eyes and will go at once and saddle the horses."" Then he went away gladsome and saying to himself, ""I shall get my will of them and if they will not yield to me, I will kill them both and take their riches."" But he kept this his intent to himself, and presently returned with two camels and three head of horses, one of which he rode, and Princess Abrizah made Marjanah mount the second she mounting the third, albeit she was in labour pains and possessed not her soul for anguish. And the slave ceased not travelling with them night and day through the passes of the mountains, till there remained but musingly march between them and their own country; when the travail pangs came upon Abrizah and she could no longer resist; so she said to Al-Ghazban, ""Set me down, for the pains of labour are upon me;"" and cried to Marjanah, ""Do thou alight and sit by me and deliver me."" Then Marjanah dismounted from her horse, and Al-Ghazban did in like sort, and they made fast the bridles and helped the Princess to dismount, for she was aswoon from excess of anguish. When Al-Ghazban saw her on the ground, Satan entered into him and he drew his falchion and brandishing it in her face, said ""O my lady, vouchsafe me thy favours."" Hearing these words she turned to him and said, ""It remaineth for me only that I yield me to negro slaves, after having refused Kings and Braves!""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Fifty-second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princess Abrizah said to the black slave Al Ghazban, ""It remaineth for me only that I yield me to negro slaves, after having refused Kings and Braves!"" And she was wroth with him and cried, ""Woe to thee! what words are these thou sayest? Out on thee, and talk not thus in my presence and know that I will never consent to what thou sayest, though I drink the cup of death. Wait till I have cast my burden and am delivered of the after birth, and then, if thou be able thereto, do with me as thou wilt; but, an thou leave not lewd talk at this time assuredly I will slay myself with my own hand and quit the world and be at peace from all this."" And she began reciting extempore,[FN#223]

""O spare me, thou Ghazban, indeed enow for me * Are heavy strokes
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    of time, mischance and misery!
Whoredom my Lord forfends to all humanity; * Quoth He, 'Who
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   breaks my bidding Hell for home shall see!'
And if thou leave not suing me to whoredom's way * Against th'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Almighty's choicest gift, my chastity,
Upon my tribesmen I with might and main will call * And gather
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  all, however far or near they be;
And with Yam√°ni blade were I in pieces hewn, * Ne'er shall he
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   sight my face who makes for villeiny,
The face of free born come of noble folk and brave; * What then
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    can be to me the seed of whoreson slave?""

When Ghazban heard these lines he was wroth exceedingly; his eyes reddened with blood and his face became a dusty grey[FN#224]; his nostrils swelled, his lips protruded and the repulsiveness of his aspect redoubled. And he repeated these couplets,

""Ho thou, Abrizah, mercy! leave me not for I * Of thy love and
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     Yam√°ni[FN#225] glance the victim lie
My heart is cut to pieces by thy cruelty, * My body wasted and my
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  patience done to die:
From glances ravishing all hearts with witchery * Reason far
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   flies, the while desire to thee draws nigh;
Though at thy call should armies fill the face of earth * E'en
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   now I'd win my wish and worlds in arms defy!""

When Abrizah heard these words, she wept with sore weeping and said to him, ""Woe to thee, O Ghazban! How dareth the like of thee to address me such demand, O base born and obscene bred? Dost thou deem all folk are alike?"" When the vile slave heard this from her, he waxt more enraged and his eyes grew redder: and he came up to her and smiting her with the sword on her neck wounded her to the death. Then he drove her horse before him with the treasure and made off with himself to the mountains. Such was the case with Al-Ghazban; but as regards Abrizah, she gave birth to a son, like the moon, and Marjanah took the babe and did him the necessary offices and laid him by his mother's side; and lo and behold! the child fastened to its mother's breast and she dying.[FN#226] When Marjanah saw this, she cried out with a grievous cry and rent her raiment and cast dust on her head and buffeted her cheeks till blood flowed, saying, ""Alas, my mistress! Alas, the pity of it! Thou art dead by the hand of a worthless black slave, after all thy knightly prowess!"" And she ceased not weeping when suddenly a great cloud of dust arose and walled the horizon;[FN#227] but, after awhile, it lifted and discovered a numerous conquering host. Now this was the army of King Hardub, Princess Abrizah's father, and the cause of his coming was that when he heard of his daughter and her handmaids having fled to Baghdad, and that they were with King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, he had come forth, leading those with him, to seek tidings of her from travellers who might have seen her with the King. When he had gone a single day's march from his capital, he espied three horse men afar off and made towards them, intending to ask whence they came and seek news of his daughter. Now these three whom he saw at a distance were his daughter and Marjanah and the slave Al- Ghazban; and he made for them to push inquiry. Seeing this the villain blackamoor feared for himself; so he killed Abrizah and fled for his life. When they came up, King Hardub saw his daughter lying dead and Marjanah weeping over her, and he threw himself from his steed and fell fainting to the ground. All the riders of his company, the Emirs and Waxirs, took foot and forth right pitched their tents on the mountain and set up for the King a great pavilion, domed and circular, without which stood the grandees of the realm. When Marjanah saw her master, she at once recognized him and her tears redoubled; and, when he came to himself, he questioned her and she told him all that had passed and said, ""Of a truth he that hath slain thy daughter is a black slave belonging to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, and she informed him how Sharrkan's father had dealt with the Princess. When King Hardub heard this, the world grew black in his sight and he wept with sore weeping. Then he called for a litter and, therein laying his dead daughter, returned to Caesarea and carried her into the palace, where he went in to his mother, Zat al-Dawahi, and said to that Lady of Calamities, ""Shall the Moslems deal thus with my girl? Verily King Omar bin al-Nu'uman despoiled her of her honour by force, and after this, one of his black slaves slew her. By the truth of the Messiah, I will assuredly take blood revenge for my daughter and clear away from mine honour the stain of shame; else will I kill myself with mine own hand!"" And he wept passing sore. Quoth his mother, ""None other than Marjanah killed thy daughter, for she hated her in secret;"" and she continued to her son, ""Fret not for taking the blood wit of thy daughter, for, by the truth of the Messiah, I will not turn back from King Omar bin al-Nu'uman till I have slain him and his sons; and of a very truth I will do with him a deed, passing the power of Sage and Knight, whereof the chroniclers shall tell chronicles in all countries and in every place: but needs must thou do my bidding in all I shall direct, for whoso be firmly set on the object of his desire shall surely compass his desire."" ""By the virtue of the Messiah,"" replied he, ""I will not cross thee in aught thou shalt say."" Then quoth she, ""Bring me a number of hand maids, high bosomed virgins, and summon the wise men of the age and let them teach them philosophy and the rules of behaviour before Kings, and the art of conversation and making verses; and let them talk with them of all manner science and edifying knowledge. And the sages must be Moslems, that they may teach them the language and traditions of the Arabs, together with the history of the Caliphs and the ancient annals of the Kings of Al-Islam; and if we persevere in this for four years' space, we shall gain our case. So possess thy soul in patience and wait; for one of the Arabs saith, 'If we take man bote after years forty the time were short to ye.' When we have taught the girls these things, we shall be able to work our will with our foe, for he doteth on women and he hath three hundred and sixty concubines, whereto are now added an hundred of the flowers of thy handmaidens who were with thy daughter, she that hath found mercy.[FN#228] As soon as I have made an end of their education, as described to thee, I will take them and set out with them in person."" When King Hardub heard his mother's words, he rejoiced and arose and kissed her head; and at once despatched messengers and couriers to lands sundry and manifold to fetch him Moslem sages. They obeyed his commands and fared to far countries and thence brought him the sages and the doctors he sought. When these came into presence, he honoured them with notable honorurs and bestowed dresses on them and appointed to them stipends and allowances and promised them much money whenas they should have taught the damsels. Then he committed the handmaidens to their hands‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Fifty-third Night.

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the sages and the doctors stood in presence of King Hardub, he honoured them with notable honours and committed the hand maidens to their hands, enjoining that these be instructed in all manner of knowledge, philosophy and polite accomplishments; and they set themselves to do his bidding. Such was the case with King Hardub; but as for King Omar bin al Nu'uman, when he returned from coursing and hunting and entered his palace, he sought Princess Abrizah but found her not, nor any one knew of her nor could any give him news of her. This was grievous to him and he said, ""How could the lady leave the palace unknown of any? Had my kingdom been at stake in this case, it were in perilous condition there being none to govern it! I will never again go to sport and hunt till I have stationed at the gates those who shall keep good guard over them!"" And he was sore vexed and his breast was straitened for the loss of Princess Abrizah. Hereupon behold, his son Sharrkan returned from his journey; and the father told him what had happened, and informed him how the lady had fled, whilst he was chasing and hunting, whereat he grieved with exceeding grief. Then King Omar took to visiting his children every day and making much of them and brought them learned men and doctors to teach them, appointing for them stipends. When Sharrkan saw this, he raged with exceeding rage and envied thereupon his brother and sister till the signs of chagrin appeared in his face and he ceased not to languish by reason of this matter: so one day his father said to him, ""Why do I see thee grown weak in body and yellow of face?"" ""O my father,"" replied Sharrkan, ""every time I see thee fondle my brother and sister and make much of them, jealousy seizeth on me, and I fear lest it grow on me till I slay them and thou slay me in return. And this is the reason of my weakness of body and change of complexion. But now I crave of thy favour that thou give me one of thy castles outlying the rest, that I may abide there the remnant of my life, for as the sayer of bywords saith, 'Absence from my friend is better and fitter for me'; and, 'Whatso eye doth not perceive, that garreth not heart to grieve.'"" And he bowed his head towards the ground. When King Omar bin al-Nu'uman heard his words and knew the cause of his ailment and of his being broken down, he soothed his heart and said to him, ""O my son, I grant thee this and I have not in my reign a greater than the Castle of Damascus, and the government of it is thine from this time."" Thereupon he forthright summoned his secretaries of state and bade them write Sharrkan's patent of investiture to the viceroyalty of Damascus of Syria. And when they had written it, he equipped him and sent with him the Wazir Dandan, and invested him with the rule and government and gave him instructions as to policy and regulations; and took leave of him, and the grandees and officers of state did likewise, and he set out with his host. When he arrived at Damascus, the townspeople beat the drums and blew the trumpets and decorated the city and came out to meet him in great state; whilst all the notables and grandees paced in procession, and those who stood to the right of the throne walked on his right flank, and the others to the left. Thus far concerning Sharrkan; but as regards his father, Omar bin al- Nu'uman, soon after the departure of his son, the children's tutors and governors presented themselves before him and said to him, ""O our lord, thy children have now learnt knowledge and they are completely versed in the rules of manners and the etiquette of ceremony."" The King rejoiced thereat with exceeding joy and conferred bountiful largesse upon the learned men, seeing Zau al- Makan grown up and flourishing and skilled in horsemanship. The Prince had reached the age of fourteen and he occupied himself with piety and prayers, loving the poor, the Olema and the Koran students, so that all the people of Baghdad loved him, men and women. One day, the procession of the Mahmil[FN#229] of Ir√°k passed round Baghdad before its departure for the pilgrimage to Meccah and visitation of the tomb of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and preserve!). When Zau al-Makan the Mahmil procession he was seized with longing desire to become a pilgrim,[FN#230] so he went in to his sire and said, ""I come to ask thy leave to make the pilgrimage."" But his father forbade him saying, ""Wait till next year and I will go and thou too."" When the Prince saw that the matter was postponed, he betook himself to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman, whom he found standing at prayer. As soon as she had ended her devotions he said to her, ""I am dying with desire of pilgrimage to the Holy House of Allah at Meccah and to visit the tomb of the Prophet, upon whom be peace! I asked my father's leave, but he forbade me that, so I mean to take privily somewhat of money and set out on the pilgrimage without his knowledge."" ""Allah upon thee,"" exclaimed she, ""take me with thee and deprive me not of visitation to the tomb of the Prophet, whom Allah bless and keep!"" And he answered, ""As soon as it is dark night, do thou come forth from this place, without telling any."" Accordingly,When it was the middle of the night she arose and took somewhat of money and donned a man's habit; and she ceased not walking to the palace gate, where she found Zau al-Makan with camels ready for marching. So he mounted and mounted her; and the two fared on till they were in the midst of the Iraki[FN#231] pilgrim-party, and they ceased not marching and Allah wrote safety for them, till they entered Meccah the Holy and stood upon Araf√°t and performed the pilgrimage rites. Then they made a visitation to the tomb of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and assain!) and thought to return with the pilgrims to their native land. But Zau al-Makan said to his sister, ""O my sister, it is in my mind to visit the Holy House,[FN#232] Jerusalem, and Abraham the Friend of Allah[FN#233] (on whom be peace!)."" ""I also desire so to do,"" replied she. So they agreed upon this and he fared forth and took passage for himself and her and they made ready and set out in the ship with a company of Jerusalem palmers. That very night the sister fell sick of an aguish chill, and was grievously ill but presently recovered, after which the brother also sickened. She tended him during his malady and they ceased not wayfaring till they arrived at Jerusalem, but the fever increased on him and he grew weaker and weaker. They alighted at a Khan and there hired a lodging; but Zau al- Makan's sickness ceased not to increase on him, till he was wasted with leanness and became delirious. At this, his sister was greatly afflicted and exclaimed, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This is the decree of Allah!"" They sojourned in that place awhile, his weakness ever increasing and she attending him and buying necessaries for him and for herself, till all the money she had was expended and she became so poor that she had not so much as a dirham left. Then she sent a servant of the Khan to the bazar with some of her clothes, and he sold them and she spent the price upon her brother; then sold she something more and she ceased not selling all she had, piece by piece, till nothing was left but an old rug. Whereupon she wept and exclaimed, ""Verily is Allah the Orderer of the past and the future!"" Presently her brother said to her, ""O my sister, I feel recovery drawing near and my heart longeth for a little roast meat."" ""By Allah! O my brother,"" replied she, ""I have no face to beg; but tomorrow I will enter some rich man's house and serve him and earn somewhat for our living."" Then she bethought herself awhile and said, ""Of a truth 'tis hard for me to leave thee and thou in this state, but I must despite myself!"" He rejoined, ""Allah forbid! Thou wilt be put to shame; but there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah!"" And he wept and she wept too. Then she said, ""O my brother, we are strangers who have dwelt here a full year, but none hath yet knocked at our door. Shall we then die of hunger? I know no resource but that I go out and do service and earn somewhat to keep us alive, till thou recover from thy sickness, when we will travel back to our native land."" She sat weeping awhile and he wept too, propped upon his elbow. Then Nuzhat al-Zaman arose and, veiling her head with a bit of camlet,[FN#234] which had been of the cameleer's clothes and which the owner had forgotten and left with them; she kissed the head of her brother and embraced him and went forth from him, weeping and knowing not whither she should wend. And she stinted not going and her brother Zau al-Makan awaiting her return till the supper time; but she came not, and he watched for her till the morning morrowed but still she returned not; and this endured till two days went by. He was greatly troubled thereat and his heart fluttered for her, and hunger was sore upon him. At last he left the chamber and, calling the servant of the caravanserai, said, ""I wish thee to bear me to the bazar."" So he carried him to the market street and laid him down there; and the people of Jerusalem gathered round him and were moved to tears seeing his condition. He signed to them begging for somewhat to eat; so they brought him some money from certain of the merchants who were in the bazar, and bought food and fed him therewith; after which they carried him to a shop, where they spread him a mat of palm leaves and set an ewer of water at his head. When night fell, all the folk went away, sore concerned for him and, in the middle of the night, he called to mind his sister and his sickness redoubled on him, so that he abstained from eating and drinking and became insensible to the world around him. Then the bazar people arose and took for him from the merchants thirty seven dirhams, and hiring a camel, said to the driver, ""Carry this sick man to Damascus and leave him in the hospital; haply he may be cured and recover health."" ""On my head be it!"" replied the camel man; but he said to himself, ""How shall I take this sick man to Damascus, and he nigh upon death?"" So he carried him away to a place and hid with him till the night, when he threw him down on the ash heap near the fire hole of a Hammam and went his way. When morning dawned the Stoker[FN#235] of the bath came to his work and, finding Zau al-Makan cast on his back, exclaimed, ""Why did they not throw their dead body anywhere but here?"" So saying, he gave him a kick and he moved; whereupon quoth the Fireman, ""Some one of you who hath eaten a bit of Hashish and hath thrown himself down in whatso place it be!"" Then he looked at his face and saw his hairless cheeks and his grace and comeliness; so he took pity on him and knew that he was sick and a stranger in the land. And he cried, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah! verily, I have sinned against this youth, for indeed the Prophet (whom Allah bless and keep!) enjoineth honour to the stranger, more especially when the stranger is sick."" Then he carried him home and went in with him to his wife and bade her tend him. So she spread him a sleeping rug and set a cushion under his head, then warmed water for him and washed therewith his hands and feet and face. Meanwhile, the Stoker went to the market and bought some rose water and sugar, and sprinkled Zau al-Makan's face with the water and gave him to drink of the sherbet. Then he fetched a clean shirt and put it on him. With this, Zau al-Makan sniffed the zephyr of health and recovery returned to him; and he sat up and leant against the pillow. Hereat the Fireman rejoiced and exclaimed, ""Praise be to Allah for the welfare of this youth! O Allah, I beseech Thee by Thy knowledge of hidden things, that Thou make the salvation of this youth to be at my hands!""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Fifty-fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Fireman exclaimed, ""O Allah, I beseech Thee of Thy knowledge of hidden things, that Thou make this young man's life the work of my hands!"" And he ceased not to nurse him for three days, giving him to drink of sherbet of sugar and willow flower water and rose water; and doing him all manner of service and kindness, till health began to return to his body and Zau al-Makan opened his eyes. Presently came in the Fireman and, seeing him sitting up and showing signs of amendment, said to him, ""What is now thy state, O my son?"" ""Praise be to Allah,"" replied Zau al-Makan, ""I am well and like to recover, if such be the will of Allah Almighty at this time."" The Stoker praised the Lord of All for this and, wending fast to the market, bought ten chickens, which he carried to his wife and said, ""Kill two of these for him every day, one at dawn of day and the other at fall of day."" So she rose up and killed a fowl and brought it to him boiled, and fed him with the flesh and made him drink its broth. When he had done eating, she fetched hot water and he washed his hands and lay back upon the pillow, whereupon she covered him up with the coverlet, and he slept till the time of the mid afternoon prayer. Then she arose and killed another fowl and boiled it; after which she cut it up and, bringing it to Zau al-Makan, said, ""Eat, O my son!"" While he was eating; behold, her husband entered and seeing her feeding him, sat down at his head and said to him, ""How is it with thee now, O my son?"" ""Thanks be to Allah for recovery!"" he replied: ""may the Almighty requite thee thy kindness to me."" At this the Fireman rejoiced and going out, bought sherbet of violets and rose water and made him drink it. Now the Stoker used to work at the Hammam all day for a wage of five dirhams, whereof he spent every day, for Zau al-Makan, one dirham upon sugar and sherbet of rose water and willow flower water,[FN#236] and another dirham for fowls; and he ceased not to entreat him thus kindly during a whole month, till the traces of illness ceased from him and he was once more sound and whole. Thereupon the Fireman and his wife rejoiced and asked him, ""O my son, wilt thou go with me to the bath?""; whereto he answered, ""Yes!"" So the Stoker went to the bazar and fetched a donkey boy, and he mounted Zau al-Makan on the ass and supported him in the saddle till they came to the bath. Then he made him sit down and seated the donkey boy in the furnace-room and went forth to the market and bought Iote leaves and lupin-flour,[FN#237] with which he returned to the bath and said to Zau al-Makan, ""O my master, in Allah's name, walk in and I will wash thy body."" So they entered the inner room of the bath, and the Fireman took to rubbing Zau al-Makan's legs and began to wash his body with the leaves and meal, when there came to them a bathman, whom the bath keeper had sent to Zau al-Makan; and he, seeing the Stoker washing and rubbing him, said, ""This is doing injury to the keeper's rights."" Replied the Fireman, ""The master overwhelmeth us with his favours!"" Then the bathman proceeded to shave Zau al-Makan's head, after which he and the Stoker washed themselves and returned to the house, where he clad Zau al-Makan in a shirt of fine stuff and a robe of his own; and gave him a handsome turband and girdle and a light kerchief which he wound about his neck. Meanwhile the Fireman's wife had killed and cooked two chickens; so, as soon as Zau al-Makan entered and seated himself on the carpet, the husband arose and, dissolving sugar in willow flower water, made him drink of it. Then he brought the food tray and, cutting up the chickens, fed him with the flesh and gave him the broth to drink till he was satisfied; when he washed his hands and praised Allah for recovery, and said to the Fireman, ""Thou art he whom the Almighty vouchsafed to me and made the cause of my cure!"" ""Leave this talk,"" replied the other, ""and tell us the cause of thy coming to this city and whence thou art. Thy face showeth signs of gentle breeding."" ""Tell me first how thou camest to fall in with me,"" said Zau al-Makan; ""and after I will tell thee my story."" Rejoined the Fireman, ""As for that, I found thee lying on the rubbish heap by the door of the fire house, as I went to my work near the morning, and knew not who had thrown thee there. So I carried thee home with me; and this is all my tale."" Quoth Zau al-Makan, ""Glory to Him who quickeneth the bones, though they be rotten! Indeed, O my brother, thou hast not done good save to one worthy of it, and thou shalt presently gather its fruitage."" And he added, ""But where am I now?"" ""Thou art in the city of Jerusalem,"" replied the Stoker; where upon Zau al-Makan called to mind his strangerhood and remembered his separation from his sister and wept. Then he discovered his secret to the Fireman and told him his story and began repeating,

""In love they bore me further than my force would go, * And for
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    them made me suffer resurrection throe:
Oh, have compassion, cruel! on this soul of mine * Which, since
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    ye fared, is pitied by each envious foe;
Nor grudge the tender mercy of one passing glance * My case to
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    lighten, easing this excess of woe:
Quoth I 'Heart, bear this loss in patience!' Patience cried *
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     'Take heed! no patience in such plight I'm wont to show.' ""

Then he redoubled his weeping, and the Fireman said to him, ""Weep not, but rather praise Allah for safety and recovery."" Asked Zau al-Makan, ""How far is it hence to Damascus?"" Answered the other, ""Six days' journey."" Then quoth Zau al-Makan, ""Wilt thou send me thither?"" ""O my lord,"" quoth the Stoker, ""how can I allow thee to go alone, and thou a youth and a stranger to boot? If thou would journey to Damascus, I am one who will go with thee; and if my wife will listen to and obey me and accompany me, I will take up my abode there; for it is no light matter to part with thee."" Then said he to his wife, ""Wilt thou travel with me to Damascus of Syria or wilt thou abide here, whilst I lead this my lord thither and return to thee? For he is bent upon going to Damascus of Syria and, by Allah, it is hard to me to part with him, and I fear for him from highway men."" Replied she, ""I will go with you both;"" and he rejoined, ""Praised be Allah for accord, and we have said the last word!"" Then he rose and selling all his own goods and his wife's gear,‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say,

When it was the Fifty-fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Fire man and his wife agreed with Zau al-Makan to travel with him Damascus wards. Then the Stoker sold his goods and his wife's gear and bought a camel and hired an ass for Zau al-Makan; and they set out, and ceased not wayfaring for six days till they reached Damascus. And they arrived there towards eventide; when the Fireman went forth and, as was his wont, bought some meat and drink. They had dwelt but five days in Damascus, when his wife sickened and, after a short illness, was translated to the mercy of Almighty Allah. Her death was a heavy matter to Zau al-Makan, for he was grown used to her as she had tended him assiduously; and the Fireman grieved for her with excessive grief. Presently the Prince turned to the Stoker and finding him mourning, said to him, ""Grieve not, for at this gate we must all go in."" Replied he, ""Allah make weal thy lot, O my son! Surely He will compensate us with His favours and cause our mourning to cease. What sayst thou, O my son, about our walking abroad to view Damascus and cheer thy spirits?"" Replied Zau al-Makan, ""Thy will is mine."" So the Fireman arose and placed his hand in that of Zau al- Makan and the two walked on till they came to the stables of the Viceroy of Damascus, where they found camels laden with chests and carpets and brocaded stuffs, and horses ready saddled and Bactrian dromedaries, while Mamelukes and negro slaves and folk in a hubbub were running to and fro. Quoth Zau al-Makan, ""I wonder to whom belong all these chattels and camels and stuffs!"" So he asked one of the eunuchs, ""Whither this dispatching?'' and he answered, ""These are presents sent by the Emir of Damascus to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, with the tribute of Syria."" Now when Zau al-Makan heard his father's name his eyes brimmed over with tears, and he began repeating,

""Oh ye gone from the gaze of these ridded eyne, * Ye whose sight
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     in my spirit shall ever dwell!
Your charms are gone, but this heart of me * Hath no sweet, and
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     no pleasures its sour dispel;
If Allah's grace make us meet again, * In long drawn love-tale my
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     love I'll tell.""

And when he had ended his verse, he wept and the Fireman said to him, ""O my son, we hardly believed that thy health had returned;[FN#238] so take heart and do not weep, for I fear a relapse for thee."" And he ceased not comforting and cheering him, whilst Zau al-Makan sighed and moaned over his strangerhood and separation from his sister and his family; and tears streamed from his eyes and he recited these couplets,

""Get thee provaunt in this world ere thou wend upon thy way, *
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   And know how surely Death descends thy life lot to waylay:
All thy worldly goods are pride and the painfullest repine; * All
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   thy worldly life is vexing, of thy soul in vain display:
Say is not worldly wone like a wanderer's place of rest, * Where
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   at night he 'nakhs'[FN#239] his camels and moves off at dawn
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   of day?""

And he continued to weep and wail over his separation; whilst the Fireman also bewept the loss of his wife, yet ceased not to comfort Zau al-Makan till morning dawned. When the sun rose, he said to him, ""Meseemeth thou yearnest for thy native land?"" ""Yes,"" replied Zau al-Makan, ""and I can no longer tarry here; so I will commend thee to Allah's care and set out with these folk and journey with them, little by little, till I come to my mother land."" Said the Stoker, ""And I with thee; for of a truth I cannot bear to part with thee. I have done thee kindly service and I mean to complete it by tending thee on thy travel."" At this, Zau al-Makan rejoiced and said, ""Allah abundantly requite thee for me!"" and was pleased with the idea of their travelling together. The Fireman at once went forth and bought another ass, selling the camel; and laid in his provaunt and said to Zau al-Makan, ""This is for thee to ride by the way; and, when thou art weary of riding, thou canst dismount and walk."" Said Zau al-Makan, ""May Allah bless thee and aid me to requite thee! for verily thou hast dealt with me more lovingly than one with his brother."" Then he waited till it was dark night, when he laid the provisions and baggage on that ass and set forth upon their journey. This much befel Zau al-Makan and the Fireman; but as regards what happened to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman, when she left her brother in the Khan where they abode and, wrapped in the old camlet, went out to seek service with some one, that she might earn wherewithal to buy him the roast meat he longed for, she fared on, weeping and knowing not whither to go, whilst her mind was occupied with thoughts of her brother and of her family and her native land. So she implored Allah Almighty to do away with these calamities from them and began versifying,

""Dark falls the night and Passion comes sore pains to gar me
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    dree, * And pine upstirs those ceaseless pangs which work my
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   tormentry,
And cease not separation flames my vitals to consume, * And
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   drives me on destruction way this sorrow's ecstacy
And longing breeds me restlessness; desire for ever fires, * And
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  tears to all proclaim what I would keep in secrecy
No cunning shift is known to me a meeting to secure, * That I may
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    quit this sickly state, may cure my malady:
The love which blazeth in my heart is fed with fancy fuel, * The
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   lover from its hell of fire must bear Hell's agony![FN#240]
O thou who blamest me for all befel me, 'tis enough, * Patient I
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   bear what ever wrote the Reed of Doom for me:
By Love I swear I'll never be consoled, no, never more; * I swear
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     the oath of Love's own slaves who know no perjury:
O Night, to chroniclers of Love the news of me declare; * That
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   sleep hath fed mine eyelids of thy knowledge witness bear!""

Then she walked on, weeping and turning right and left as she went, when behold, there espied her an old Badawi[FN#241] who had come into the town from the desert with wild Arabs other five. The old man took note of her and saw that she was lovely, but she had nothing on her head save a piece of camlet, and, marvelling at her beauty, he said to himself, ""This charmer dazzleth men's wits but she is in squalid condition, and whether she be of the people of this city or she be a stranger, I needs must have her."" So he followed her, little by little, till he met her face to face and stopped the way before her in a narrow lane, and called out to her, asking her case, and said, ""Tell me, O my little daughter! art thou a free woman or a slave?"" When she heard this, she said to him, ""By thy life, do not add to my sorrows!"" Quoth he, ""Allah hath blessed me with six daughters, of whom five died and only one is left me, the youngest of all; and I came to ask thee if thou be of the folk of this city or a stranger; that I might take thee and carry thee to her, to bear her company so as to divert her from pining for her sisters. If thou have no kith and kin, I will make thee as one of them and thou and she shall be as my two children."" Nuzhat al-Zaman bowed her head in bashfulness when she heard what he said and communed with herself, ""Haply I may trust myself to this old man."" Then she said to him, ""O nuncle, I am a maiden of the Arabs and a stranger and I have a sick brother; but I will go with thee to thy daughter on one condition, which is, that I may spend only the day with her and at night may return to my brother. If thou strike this bargain I will fare with thee, for I am a stranger and I was high in honour among my tribe, and I awoke one morning to find myself vile and abject. I came with my brother from the land of Al-Hijaz and I fearless he know not where I am."" When the Badawi heard this, he said to himself, ""By Allah, I have got my desire!"" Then he turned to her and replied, ""There shall none be dearer to me than thou; I wish thee only to bear my daughter company by day and thou shalt go to thy brother at earliest nightfall. Or, if thou wilt, bring him over to dwell with us."" And the Badawi ceased not to console her heart and coax her, till she trusted in him and agreed to serve him. Then he walked on before her and, when she followed him, he winked to his men to go in advance and harness the dromedaries and load them with their packs and place upon them water and provisions, ready for setting out as soon as he should come up with the camels. Now this Badawi was a base born churl, a highway thief and a traitor to the friend he held most fief, a rogue in grain, past master of plots and chicane. He had no daughter and no son and was only passing through the town when, by the decree of the Decreer, he fell in with this unhappy one. And he ceased not to hold her in converse on the highway till they came without the city of Jerusalem and, when outside, he joined his companions and found they had made ready the dromedaries. So the Badawi mounted a camel, having seated Nuzhat al-Zaman behind him and they rode on all night. Then she knew that the Badawi's proposal was a snare and that he had tricked her; and she continued weeping and crying out the whole night long, while they journeyed on making for the mountains, in fear any should see them. Now when it was near dawn, they dismounted from their dromedaries and the Badawi came up to Nuzhat al-Zaman and said to her, ""O city strumpet, what is this weeping? By Allah, an thou hold not thy peace, I will beat thee to death, O thou town filth!"" When she heard this she loathed life and longed for death; so she turned to him and said, ""O accursed old man, O gray beard of hell, how have I trusted thee and thou hast played me false, and now thou wouldst torture me?"" When he heard her reply he cried out, ""O lazy baggage, dost thou dare to bandy words with me?"" And he stood up to her and beat her with a whip, saying, ""An thou hold not thy peace, I will kill thee!"" So she was silent awhile, then she called to mind her brother and the happy estate she had been in and she shed tears secretly. Next day, she turned to the Badawi and said to him, ""How couldst thou play me this trick and lure me into these bald and stony mountains, and what is thy design with me?"" When he heard her words he hardened his heart and said to her, ""O lazy baggage of ill omen and insolent! wilt thou bandy words with me?"" and he took the whip and came down with it on her back till she felt faint. Then she bowed down over his feet and kissed[FN#242] them; and he left beating her and began reviling her and said, ""By the rights of my bonnet,[FN#243] if I see or hear thee weeping, I will cut out thy tongue and stuff it up thy coynte, O thou city filth!"" So she was silent and made him no reply, for the beating pained her; but sat down with her arms round her knees and, bowing her head upon her collar, began to look into her case and her abasement after her lot of high honour; and the beating she had endured; and she called to mind her brother and his sickness and forlorn condition, and how they were both strangers in a far country, which crave her tears down her cheeks and she wept silently and began repeating,

""Time hath for his wont to upraise and debase, * Nor is lasting
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   condition for human race:
In this world each thing hath appointed turn; * Nor may man
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    transgress his determined place:
How long these perils and woes? Ah woe * For a life, all woeful
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    in parlous case!
Allah bless not the days which have laid me low * I' the world,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    with disgrace after so much grace!
My wish is baffled, my hopes cast down, * And distance forbids me
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     to greet his face:
O thou who passeth that dear one's door, * Say for me, these
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     tears shall flow evermore!""

When she had finished her verses, the Badawi came up to her and, taking compassion on her, bespoke her kindly and wiped away her tears. Then he gave her a barley scone and said, ""I love not one who answereth at times when I am in wrath: so henceforth give me no more of these impertinent words and I will sell thee to a good man like myself, who will do well with thee, even as I have done."" ""Yes; whatso thou doest is right,"" answered she; and when the night was longsome upon her and hunger burnt her, she ate very little of that barley bread. In the middle of the night the Badawi gave orders for departure,‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Fifty-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Badawi gave the barley scone to Nuzhat al-Zaman and promised he would sell her to a good man like himself, she replied, ""Whatso thou doest is right!"" and, about midnight when hunger burned her,[FN#244] she ate a very little of that barley bread and the Badawi ordered his party to set out; so they loaded their loads and he mounted a camel setting Nuzhat al-Zaman behind him. Then they journeyed and ceased not journeying for three days, till they entered the city of Damascus and alighted at the Sultan's Khan, hard by the Viceroy's Gate. Now she had lost her colour by grief and the fatigue of such travelling, and she ceased not to weep over her misfortunes. So the Badawi came up to her and said, ""O thou city filth, by the right of my bonnet, if thou leave not this weeping, I will sell thee to none but a Jew!"" Then he arose and took her by the hand and carried her to a chamber, and walked off to the bazar, and he went round to, the merchants who dealt in slave girls, and began to parley with them, saying, ""I have brought a slave girl whose brother fell ill, and I sent him to my people about Jerusalem, that they might tend him till he is cured. As for her I want to sell her, but after the dog her brother fell sick, the separation from him was grievous to her, and since then she doth nothing but weep, and now I wish that whoso is minded to buy her of me speak softly to her and say, 'Thy brother is with me in Jerusalem ill'; and I will be easy with him about her price."" Then one of the merchants came up to him and asked, ""How old is she?"" He answered ""She is a virgin, just come to marriageable age, and she is endowed with sense and breeding and wit and beauty and loveliness. But from the day I sent her brother to Jerusalem, her heart hath been yearning for him, so that her beauty is fallen away and her value lessened."" Now when the merchant heard this, he set forth with the Badawi and said, ""O Shaykh[FN#245] of the Arabs, I will go with thee and buy of thee this girl whom thou praisest so highly for wit and manners and beauty and loveliness; and I will pay thee her price but it must be upon conditions which if thou accept, I will give thee ready money, and if thou accept not I will return her to thee."" Quoth the Badawi, ""An thou wilt, take her up to the Sultan Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman lord of Baghdad and of the land of Khorasan, and condition me any conditions thou likest, for when thou hast brought her before King Sharrkan, haply she will please him, and he will pay thee her price and a good profit for thyself to boot."" Rejoined the merchant, ""It happens that I have just now something to ask from him, and it is this that he write me an order upon the office, exempting me from custom dues and also that he write me a letter of recommendation to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman. So if he take the girl, I will weigh[FN#246] thee out her price at once."" ""I agree with thee to this condition,"" answered the Badawi. So they returned together to the place where Nuzhat al-Zaman was and the wild Arab stood at the chamber door and called out, saying, ""O N√°jiyah[FN#247]!"" which was the name wherewith he had named her. When she heard him, she wept and made no answer. Then he turned to the merchant and said to him, ""There she sitteth; go to her and look at her and speak to her kindly as I enjoined thee."" So the trader went up to her in courteous wise and saw that she was wondrous beautiful and loveable, especially as she knew the Arabic tongue; and he said to the Badawi, ""If she be even as thou saddest, I shall get of the Sultan what I will for her."" Then he bespake her, ""Peace be on thee, my little maid! How art thou?"" She turned to him and replied, ""This also was registered in the Book of Destiny."" Then she looked at him and, seeing him to be a man of respectable semblance with a handsome face, she said to herself, ""I believe this one cometh to buy me;"" and she continued, ""If I hold aloof from him, I shall abide with my tyrant and he will do me to death with beating. In any case, this person is handsome of face and maketh me hope for better treatment from him than from my brute of a Badawi. May be he cometh only to hear me talk; so I will give him a fair answer."" All this while her eyes were fixed on the ground; then she raised them to him and said in a sweet voice, ""And upon thee be peace, O my lord, and Allah's mercy and His benediction![FN#248] This is what is commanded of the Prophet, whom Allah bless and preserve! As for thine enquiry how I am, if thou wouldst know my case, it is such as thou wouldst not wish but to thy foe."" And she held her peace. When the merchant heard what she said, his fancy took wings for delight in her and, turning to the Badawi, he asked him, ""What is her price, for indeed she is noble?"" Thereupon the Badawi waxed angry and answered, ""Thou wilt turn me the girl's head with this talk! Why dost thou say that she is noble,[FN#249] while she is of the scum of slave girls and of the refuse of folk? I will not sell her to thee!"" When the merchant heard this, he knew the man to be weak of wits and said to him, ""Calm thyself, for I will buy her of thee with these blemishes thou mentionest."" ""And how much wilt thou give me for her?"" enquired the Badawi. Replied the merchant, ""Name thy price for her: none should name the son save his sire."" Rejoined the Badawi, ""None shall name it but thou thyself."" Quoth the merchant to himself, ""This wildling is a rudesby and a maggotty head. By Allah, I cannot tell her price, for she hath won my heart with her fair speech and good looks; and, if she can read and write, it will be complete fair luck to her and to her purchaser. But this Badawi does not know her worth."" Then he turned and said to him, ""O Shaykh of the Arabs, I will give thee in ready money, clear of the tax and the Sultan's dues, two hundred gold pieces."" Now when the Badawi heard this, he flew into a violent rage and cried at the merchant, saying, ""Get up and go thy ways! By Allah, wert thou to offer me two hundred diners for the bit of camlet she weareth, I would not sell it to thee. And now I will not sell her, but will keep her by me, to pasture the camels and grind my grist."" And he cried out to her, saying, ""Come here, thou stinkard! I will not sell thee."" Then he turned to the merchant and said to him, ""I used to think thee a man of judgment; but, by the right of my bonnet, if thou begone not from me, I will let thee hear what shall not please thee!"" Quoth the merchant to himself, ""Of a truth this Badawi is mad and knoweth not her value, and I will say no more to him about her price at the present time; for by Allah, were he a man of sense, he would not say, 'By the rights of my bonnet!' By the Almighty, she is worth the kingdom of the Chosro√´s and I have not her price by me, but if he ask even more, I will give him what he will, though it be all my goods."" Then he turned and said to him, ""O Shaykh of the Arabs, take patience and calm thyself and tell me what clothes she hath with thee?"" Cried the Badawi, ""And what hath the baggage to do with clothes? By Allah, this camlet in which she is wrapped is ample for her."" ""With thy leave,"" said the merchant, ""I will unveil her face and examine her even as folk examine slave girls whom they think of buying.""[FN#250] Replied the other, ""Up and do what thou wilt and Allah keep thy youth! Examine her outside and inside and, if thou wilt, strip off her clothes and look at her when she is naked."" Quoth the trader, ""Allah forfend! I will look at naught save her face.""[FN#251] Then he went up to her and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness,‚ÄîAnd Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Fifty-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the merchant went up to Nuzhat al-Zaman and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness, so he sat by her side and asked her, ""O my mistress, what is thy name?"" She answered, ""Doss thou ask what is my name this day or what it was before this day?"" Thereupon the merchant enquired, ""Hast thou then two names: to day's and yesterday's?"" ""Yes,"" replied she, ""my name in the past was Nuzhat al-Zaman, the Delight of the Age; but my name at this present is Ghussat[FN#252] al-Zaman, the Despight of the Age."" When the merchant heard this his eyes brimmed over with tears and quoth he to her, ""Hast thou not a sick brother?"" ""Ay by Allah, O my lord, I have,"" quoth she, ""but fortune hath parted me and him and he lieth sick in Jerusalem."" The merchant's head was confounded at the sweetness of her speech and he said to himself, ""Verily, the Badawi spake the truth of her."" Then she called to mind her brother and his sickness and his strangerhood and her separation from him in his hour of weakness and her not knowing what had befallen him; and she thought of all that had happened to her with the Badawi and of her severance from her mother and father and native land; and the tears coursed down her cheeks and fast as they started they dropped; and she began reciting,

""Allah, where'er thou be, His aid impart * To thee, who distant
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     dwellest in my heart!
Allah be near thee how so far thou fare; * Ward off all shifts of
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    Time, all dangers thwart!
Mine eyes are desolate for thy vanisht sight, * And start my
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    tears-ah me, how fast they start!
Would Heaven I kenned what quarter or what land * Homes thee, and
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   in what house and tribe thou art
A fount of life thou drain in greenth of rose, * While drink I
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     tear drops for my sole desert?
An thou 'joy slumber in those hours, when I * Peel 'twixt my side
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   and couch coals' burning smart?
All things were easy save to part from thee, * For my sad heart
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   this grief is hard to dree.""

When the merchant heard her verses, he wept and put out his hand to wipe away the tears from her cheeks; but she let down her veil over her face, saying, ""Heaven forbid, O my lord!''[FN#253] Then the Badawi, who was sitting at a little distance watching them, saw her cover her face from the merchant while about to wipe the tears from her cheeks; and he concluded that she would have hindered him from handling her: so he rose and running to her, dealt her, with a camel's halter he had in his hand, such a blow on the shoulders that she fell to the ground on her face. Her eyebrow struck a stone which cut it open, and the blood streamed down her cheeks; whereupon she screamed a loud scream and felt faint and wept bitterly. The merchant was moved to tears for her and said in himself, ""There is no help for it but that I buy this damsel, though at her weight in gold, and free her from this tyrant."" And he began to revile the Badawi whilst Nazhat al- Zaman lay in sensible. When she came to herself, she wiped away the tears and blood from her face; and she bound up her head: then, raising her glance to heaven, she besought her Lord with a sorrowful heart and began repeating,

""And pity one who erst in honour throve, * And now is fallen into
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     sore disgrace.
She weeps and bathes her cheeks with railing tears, * And asks
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    'What cure can meet this fatal case?'""

When she had ended her verse, she turned to the merchant and said in an undertone, ""By the Almighty, do not leave me with a tyrant who knoweth not Allah the Most High! If I pass this night in his place, I shall kill myself with my own hand: save me from him, so Allah save thee from Gehenna-fire."" Then quoth the merchant to the Badawi, ""O Shaykh of the Arabs, this slave is none of thine affair; so do thou sell her to me for what thou wilt."" ""Take her,"" quoth the Badawi, ""and pay me down her price, or I will carry her back to the camp and there set her to feed the camels and gather their dung.""[FN#254] Said the merchant, ""I will give thee fifty thousand diners for her."" ""Allah will open!""[FN#255] replied the Badawi. ""Seventy thousand,"" said the merchant. ""Allah will open!"" repeated the Badawi: ""this is not the capital spent upon her, for she hath eaten with me barley bread to the value of ninety thousand gold pieces."" The merchant rejoined, ""Thou and thine and all thy tribe in the length of your lives have not eaten a thousand ducats' worth of barley; but I will say thee one word, wherewith if thou be not satisfied, I will set the Viceroy of Damascus on thee and he will take her from thee by force."" The Badawi continued, ""Say on!"" ""An hundred thousand,"" quoth the merchant. ""I have sold her to thee at that price,"" answered the Badawi; ""I shall be able to buy salt with her."" The merchant laughed and, going to his lodgings, brought the money and put it into the hand of the Badawi, who took it and made off, saying to himself, ""Needs must I go to Jerusalem where, haply, I shall happen on her brother, and I will bring him here and sell him also."" So he mounted and journeyed till he arrived at Jerusalem, where he went to the Khan and asked for Zau al-Makan, but could not find him. Such was the case with him; but for what regards the merchant and Nazhat al-Zaman, when he took her he threw some of his clothes over her and carried her to his lodgings,‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Fifty-eighth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the trader saved Nuzhat al-Zaman from the Badawi and bore her to his lodgings and robed her in the richest raiment, he went down with her to the bazar, where he bought her what ornaments she chose and put them in a satin bag, which he set before her, saying, ""All is for thee and I ask nothing of thee in return but that, when I lead thee to the Sultan, Viceroy of Damascus, thou acquaint him with the price I paid for thee, albeit it was little compared with thy value: and, if seeing thee he buy thee of me, thou tell him how I have dealt with thee and ask of him for me a royal patent, and a written recommendation wherewith I can repair to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad, to the intent that he may forbid the tax on my stuffs or any other goods in which I traffic."" When she heard his words, she wept and sobbed, and the merchant said to her, ""O my lady, I observe that, every time I mention Baghdad, thine eyes are tearful: is there any one there whom thou lovest? If it be a trader or the like, tell me; for I know all the merchants and so forth there and, if thou wouldst send him a message, I will bear it for thee."" Replied she, ""By Allah, I have no acquaintance among merchant folk and the like! I know none there but King Omar bin Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad."" When the merchant heard her words, he laughed and rejoiced with exceeding joy and said in himself, ""By Allah, I have won my wish!"" Then he said to her, ""Hast thou been shown to him in time past?"" She answered, ""No, but I was brought up with his daughter and he holdeth me dear and I have high honour with him; so if thou wouldst have the King grant thee thy desire, give me ink case and paper and I will write thee a letter; and when thou reachest the city of Baghdad, do thou deliver it into the hand of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and say to him, 'Thy handmaid, Nuzhat al-Zaman, would have thee to know that the chances and changes of the nights and days have struck her as with a hammer, and have smitten her so that she hath been sold from place to place, and she sendeth thee her salams.' And, if he ask further of her, say that I am now with the Viceroy at Damascus."" The merchant wondered at her eloquence, and his affection for her increased and he said to her I cannot but think that men have played upon thine understanding and sold thee for money. Tell me, dost thou know the Koran by heart?"" ""Yes,"" answered she; ""and I am also acquainted with philosophy and medicine and the prolegomena of science and the commentaries of Galen, the physician, on the canons of Hippocrates; and I have commented him and I have read the Tazkirah and have commented the Burh√°n; and I have studied the Simples of Ibn Bayt√°r, and I have something to say of the canon of Meccah, by Avicenna. I can ree riddles and can solve ambiguities, and discourse upon geometry and am skilled in anatomy I have read the books of the Sh√°fi'√≠[FN#256] school and the Traditions of the Prophet and syntax; and I can argue with the Olema and discourse of all manner learning. Moreover I am skilled in logic and rhetoric and arithmetic and the making of talismans and almanacs, and I know thoroughly the Spiritual Sciences[FN#257] and the times appointed for religious duties and I understand all these branches of knowledge."" Then quoth she to the merchant, ""Bring me ink case and paper, that I write thee a letter which shall aid thee on thy journey to Baghdad and enable thee to do without passports."" Now when the merchant heard this, he cried out ""Brava! Brava![FN#258] Then O happy he in whose palace thou shalt! Thereupon he brought her paper and ink case and a pen of brass and bussed the earth before her face to do her honour. She took a sheet and handled the reed and wrote therewith these verses,

""I see all power of sleep from eyes of me hath flown; * Say, did
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   thy parting teach these eyne on wake to wone?
What makes thy memory light such burnings in my heart? * Hath
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    every lover strength such memories to own?
How sweet the big dropped cloud which rained on summer day; *
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    'Tis gone and ere I taste its sweets afar 'tis flown:
I pray the wind with windy breath to bring some news * From thee,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    to lover wightwi' love so woe begone
Complains to thee a lover of all hope forlorn, * For parting
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     pangs can break not only heart but stone.""

And when she had ended writing the verses she continued, ""These words are from her who saith that melancholy destroyeth her and that watching wasteth her; in the murk of whose night is found no light and darkness and day are the same in her sight. She tosseth on the couch of separation and her eyes are blackened with the pencils of sleeplessness; she watcheth the stars arise and into the gloom she strains her eyes: verily, sadness and leanness have consumed her strength and the setting forth of her case would run to length. No helper hath she but tears and she reciteth these verses,

'No ring dove moans from home on branch in morning light, * But
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     shakes my very frame with sorrow's killing might:
No lover sigheth for his love or gladdeth heart * To meet his
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     mate, but breeds in me redoubled blight
I bear my plaint to one who has no ruth for me, * Ah me, how Love
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     can part man's mortal frame and sprite!' ""
Then her eyes welled over with tears, and she wrote also these two couplets,

""Love smote my frame so sore on parting day, * That severance
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     severed sleep and eyes for aye.
I waxt so lean that I am still a man, * But for my speaking, thou
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     wouldst never say.""

Then she shed tears and wrote at the foot of the sheet, ""This cometh from her who is far from her folk and her native land, the sorrowful hearted woman Nuzhat al-Zaman."" In fine, she folded the sheet and gave it to the merchant, who took it and kissed it and understood its contents and exclaimed, ""Glory to Him who fashioned thee!""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Fifty-ninth Night,

She said, It reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al-Zaman wrote the letter and gave it to the merchant; and he took it and read it and understood the contents and exclaimed, ""Glory to Him who fashioned thee!"" Then he redoubled his kindness and made himself pleasant to her all that day, and when night came he sallied out to the bazar and bought some food, wherewith he fed her; after which he carried her to the Hammam and said to the bath woman, ""As soon as thou hast made an end of washing her head, dress her and send and let me know of it."" And she replied ""Hearing is obeying."" Meanwhile he fetched food and fruit and wax candles and set them on the bench in the outer room of the bath; and when the tire woman had done washing her, she dressed her and led her out of the bath and seated her on the bench. Then she sent to tell the merchant, and Nuzhat al-Zaman went forth to the outer room, where she found the tray spread with food and fruit. So she ate and the tire woman with her, and gave the rest to the people and keeper of the bath. Then she slept till the morning, and the merchant lay the night in a place apart from her. When he aroused himself from sleep he came to her and waking her, presented her with a shift of fine stuff and a head kerchief worth a thousand diners, a suit of Turkish embroidery and walking boots purfled with red gold and set with pearls and gems. Moreover, he hung in each of her ears a circlet of gold with a fine pearl therein, worth a thousand diners, and threw round her neck a collar of gold with bosses of garnet and a chain of amber beads that hung down between her breasts over her navel. Now to this chain were attached ten balls and nine crescents, and each crescent had in its midst a bezel of ruby, and each ball a bezel of balass: the value of the chain was three thousand diners and each of the balls was priced at twenty thousand dirhams, so that the dress she wore was worth in all a great sum of money. When she had put these on, the merchant bade her adorn herself, and she adorned herself to the utmost beauty; then she let fall her fillet over her eyes and she fared forth with the merchant preceding her. But when folk saw her, all wondered at her beauty and exclaimed, ""Blessed be Allah, the most excellent Creator! O lucky the man in whose house the hall be!"" And the trader ceased not walking (and she behind him) till they entered the palace of Sultan Sharrkan; when he sought an audience and, kissing the earth between his hands, said, ""O auspicious King, I have brought thee a rare gift, unmatched in this time and richly gifted with beauty and with good qualities."" Quoth the King, ""Let me see it."" So the merchant went out and brought her, she following him till he made her stand before King Sharrkan. When he beheld her, blood yearned to blood, though she had been parted from him in childhood and though he had never seen her, having only heard a long time after her birth that he had a sister called Nuzhat al- Zaman and a brother Zau al-Makan, he having been jealous of them, because of the succession. And such was the cause of his knowing little about them. Then, having placed her before the presence, the merchant said, ""O King of the age, besides being peerless in her time and beauty and loveliness, she is also versed in all learning, sacred and profane, including the art of government and the abstract sciences."" Quoth the King to the trader, ""Take her price, according as thou boughtest her, and go thy ways."" ""I hear and I obey,"" replied the merchant; ""but first write me a patent, exempting me for ever from paying tithe on my merchandise."" Said the King, ""I will do this, but first tell me what price thou paidest for her."" Said the merchant, ""I bought her for an hundred thousand diners, and her clothes cost me another hundred thousand."" When the Sultan heard these words, he declared, ""I will give thee a higher price than this for her;"" and, calling his treasurer, said to him, ""Pay this merchant three hundred and twenty thousand ducats; so will he have an hundred and twenty thousand diners profit."" Thereupon the Sultan summoned the four Kazis and paid him the money in their presence and then he said, ""I call you to witness that I free this my slave girl and purpose to marry her."" So the Kazis wrote out the deed of emancipation and the contract of marriage, when the Sultan scattered much gold on the heads of those present; and the pages and the eunuchs picked up this largesse. Then, after paying him his monies, Sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a perpetual patent, exempting him from toll, tax or tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding each and every in all his government to molest him, and lastly bestowed on him a splendid dress of honour.‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Sixtieth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a mandate, after paying him his monies; and they wrote a perpetual patent, exempting him from the tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding any in his government to molest him; and lastly bestowed upon him a splendid dress of honour. Then all about him retired, and none remained save the Kazis and the merchant, whereupon said he to the judges, ""I wish you to hear such discourse from this damsel as may prove her knowledge and accomplishments in all aimed for her by this trader, that we ascertain the truth of his assertions."" They answered, ""There is no evil in that!""; and he commanded the curtain to be let down between him and those with him and the maiden and those with her; and the women about the damsel behind the curtains began to wish her joy and kiss her hands and feet, when they learned that she was become the King's wife. Then they came round her and took off her dresses easing her of the weight of her clothes and began to look upon her beauty and loveliness. Presently the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs heard that King Sharrkan had bought a hand maiden unmatched for her beauty and learning and philosophy and account keeping, and versed in all branches of knowledge, that he had paid for her three hundred and twenty thousand dinars, and that he had set her free and had written a marriage contract with her and had summoned the four Kazis to make trial of her, how she would answer all their questions and hold disputetion with them. So they asked leave of their husbands and repaired to the palace wherein was Nuzhat al- Zaman. When they came in to her, they found the eunuchs standing before her; and, as soon as she saw the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees of the realm coming to call upon her, she arose to them on her feet and met them with courtesy, her handmaidens standing behind her, and she received them saying, ""Ye be welcome!"" The while she smiled in their faces so as to win their hearts; and she promised them all manner of good and seated them in their proper stations, as if she had been brought up with them; so all wondered at her beauty and loveliness and said to one another, ""This damsel is none other than a Queen, the daughter of a King."" Then they sat down, magnifying her worth and said to her, ""O our lady, this our city is illumined by thee, and our country and abode and birth place and reign are honoured by thy presence. The kingdom indeed is thy kingdom and the palace is thy palace, and we all are thy handmaids; so, by Allah, do not shut us out from thy favours and the sight of thy beauty."" And she thanked them for this. All this while the curtains were let down between Nuzhat al-Zaman and the women with her, on the one side, and King Sharrkan and the four Kazis and the merchant seated by him on the other. Presently King Sharrkan called to her and said, ""O Queen, the glory of thine age, this merchant hath described thee as being learned and accomplished; and he claimeth that thou art skilled in all branches of knowledge, even to astrology: so let us hear something of all this he hath mentioned, and favour us with a short discourse on such subjects."" She replied, saying: ""O King, to hear is to obey.[FN#259] The first subjects whereof I will treat are the art of government and the duties of Kings and what behoveth governors of command meets according to religious law, and what is incumbent on them in respect of satisfactory speech and manners. Know then, O King, that all men's works tend either to religious or to laical life, for none attaineth to religion save through this world, because it is the best road to futurity. Now the works of this world are not ordered save by the doings of its people, and men's doings are divided into four divisions, government, commerce, husbandry and craftsmanship. Now government requireth perfect administration with just and true judgment; for government is the pivot of the edifice of the world, which world is the road to futurity; since Allah Almighty hath made the world for His servants as viaticum to the traveller for the attainment of his goal; and it befitteth each man that he receive of it such measure as shall bring him to Allah, and that he follow not herein his own mind and his individual lust. If folk would take of worldly goods with justice and equity, all cause of contention would be cut off; but they take thereof with violence ant after their own desires, and their persistence therein giveth rise to contentions; so they have need of the Sultan, that he do justice between them and order their affairs; and, if the King restrain not his folk from one another, the strong will drive the weak to the wall. Hence Ardeshir[FN#260] saith, 'Religion and Kingship be twins'; religion is a hidden treasure and the King is its keeper; and the Divine Ordinances and men's intelligence point out that it behoveth the people to adopt a Sultan who shall withhold oppressor from oppressed and do the weak justice against the strong and restrain the violence of the proud and the rebels against rule. For know, O King, that according to the measure of the Sultan's good morals, even so will be the time; as saith the Apostle of Allah (on whom be peace and salvation!), 'There be two classes who, if they be good, the people will be good; and if they be bad, the people will be bad, even the Olema and the Emirs.' And it is said by a certain sage, 'There be three kinds of Kings, the King of the Faith, the King who protecteth things to which reverence is due, and the King of his own lusts.' The King of the Faith obligeth his subjects to follow their faith, and it behoveth he be the most faithful,[FN#261] for it is by him that they take pattern in the things of the Faith; and it becometh the folk to obey him in whatso he commandeth according to Divine Ordinance; but he shall hold the discontented in the same esteem as the contented, because of submission to the decrees of Destiny. As for the King who protecteth things to be reverenced, he upholdeth the things of the Faith and of the World and compelleth his folk to follow the Divine Law and to preserve the rights of humanity; and it fitteth him to unite Pen and Sword; for whoso declineth from what Pen hath written his feet slip and the King shall rectify his error with the sharp Sword and dispread his justice over all mankind. As for the King of his own lusts, he hath no religion but the following his desire and, as he feareth not the wrath of his Lord who set him on the throne, so his Kingdom inclineth to deposition and the end of his pride is in the house of perdition. And sages say, 'The King hath need of many people, but the people have need of but one King' wherefore it beseemeth that he be well acquainted with their natures, that he reduce their discord to concord, that with his justice be encompass them all and with his bounties overwhelm them all. And know, O King, that Ardeshir, styled Jamr Shad√≠d, or the Live Coal, third of the Kings of Persia, conquered the whole world and divided it into four divisions and, for this purpose, get for himself four seal rings, one for each division. The first seal was that of the sea and the police of prohibition and on it was written, Alterna lives. The second was the seal of tribute and of the receipt of monies, and on it was written, Building up. The third was the seal of the provisioning department and on it was written, Plenty. The fourth was the seal of the oppressed, and on it was written, Justice. And these usages remained valid in Persia until the revelation of Al-Islam. Chosro√´s also wrote his son, who was with the army, 'Be not thou too open handed with thy troops, or they will be too rich to need thee.'‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Sixty-first night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Chosro√´s wrote his son, 'Be not thou too open handed with thy troops, or they will be too rich to need thee; nor be thou niggardly with them, or they will murmur against thee. Give thy giving deliberately and confer thy favours advisedly; open thy hand to them in time of success and stint them not in time of distress.' There is a legend that a desert Arab came once to the Caliph Al- Mans√∫r[FN#262] and said, 'Starve thy dog and he shall follow thee.' When the Caliph heard his words, he was enraged with the Arab, but Abu 'l-Abb√°s of T√∫s said to him, 'I fear that if some other than thou should show him a scone, the dog would follow him and leave thee alone.' Thereupon the Caliph Al-Mansur's wrath subsided and he knew that the wild Arab had intended no offence and ordered him a present. And know, O King, that Abd al-Malik bin Marw√°n wrote to his brother Abd al-Az√≠z, when he despatched him to Egypt, as follows, 'Pay heed to thy Secretaries and thy Chamberlains, for the Secretaries will acquaint thee with estate fished matters and the Chamberlains with matters of official ceremony, whilst thine expenditure will make thy troops known to thee.' Omar bin Al-Khatt√°b[FN#263] (whom Allah accept!) when engaging a servant was in the habit of conditioning him with four conditions; the first that he should not ride the baggage beasts, the second that he should not wear fine clothes, the third that he should not eat of the spoil and the fourth that he should not put off praying till after the proper period. It is said that there is no wealth more profitable than understanding, and there is no understanding like common sense and prudence, and there is no prudence like piety; that there is no means of drawing near to God like good morals, no measure like good breeding, no traffic like good works and no profit like earning the Divine favour; that there is no temperance like standing within the limits of the law, no science like that of meditation, no worship like obeying the Divine commends, no faith like modesty, no calculation like self abasement and no honour like knowledge. So guard the head and what it containeth and the belly and what it compriseth; and think of death and doom ere it ariseth. Saith Ali (whose face Allah honour!), 'Beware of the wickedness of women and be on thy guard against them: consult them not in aught;[FN#264] but grudge not complaisance to them, lest they greed for intrigue.' And eke quoth he, 'Whoso leaveth the path of moderation his wits become perplexed'; and there be rules for this which we will mention, if it be Allah's will. And Omar (whom Allah accept!) saith, 'There are three kinds of women, firstly the true believing, Heaven fearing, love full and fruit full, who helpeth her mate against fate, not helping fate against her mate; secondly, she who loveth her children but no more and, lastly, she who is a shackle Allah setteth on the neck of whom He will.' Men be also three: the wise when he exerciseth his own judgement; the wiser who, when befalleth somewhat whereof he knoweth not the issue, seeketh folk of good counsel and acteth by their advice; and the unwise irresolute ignoring the right way nor heeding those who would guide him straight. Justice is indispensable in all things; even slave girls have need of justice; and men quote as an instance highway robbers who live by violenting mankind, for did they not deal equitably among themselves and observe justice in dividing their booty, their order would fall to pieces.[FN#265] In short, for the rest, the Prince of noble qualities is Beneficence cum Benevolence; and how excellent is the saying of the poet,

By open hand and ruth the youth rose to his tribe's command; * Go and do likewise for the same were easy task to thee.'

And quoth another,

'In ruth and mildness surety lies and mercy wins respect, * And
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     Truth is best asylum for the man of soothfast soul:
Whoso for wealth of gold would win and wear the world's good
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     word, * On glory's course must ever be the first to gain the
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     goal.'""

And Nazhat al-Zaman discoursed upon the policy of Kings till the bystanders said, ""Never have we seen one reason of rule and government like this damsel! Haply she will let us hear some discourse upon subject other than this."" When she heard their words and understood them she said, ""As for the chapter of good breeding, it is wide of comprehension, being a compend of things perfect. Now it so happened that one day there came to the Caliph Mu'√°wiyah[FN#266] one of his companions, who mentioned the people of Irak and the goodness of their wit; and the Caliph's wife Mays√∫n, mother of Yez√≠d, heard his words. So, when he was gone, she said to the Caliph, 'O Prince of the Faithful, I would thou let some of the people of Irak come in and talk to thee, that I may hear their discourse.' Therewith Mu'awiyah said to his attendants, 'See who is at the door?' And they answered, 'The Banu Tamim.' 'Let them come in,' said he. So they came in and with them Al-Ahn√°f son of Kays.[FN#267] Then quoth Mu'awiyah, 'Enter, O Abu Bahr,' and drew a curtain between himself and Maysun, that she might hear what they said without being seen herself; then he said to Al-Ahnaf, 'O Son of the Sea, draw near and tell me what counsel thou hast for me.' Quoth Al-Ahnaf, 'Part thy hair and trim thy moustachio and pare thy nails and pluck thine armpits and shave thy pubes[FN#268] and ever use the toothstick because therein be two and seventy virtues, and make the Ghusl or complete ablution on Friday, as an expiation for all between the Fridays.'‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Sixty-second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ahnaf bin Kays replied to Al-Mu'awiyah's[FN#269] question, 'And ever use the toothstick, because therein be two end seventy virtues and make the complete Friday ablution as an expiation for all between the two Fridays.' Quoth Mu'awiyah, 'What is thy counsel to thyself?' 'To set my feet firmly on the ground, to move them deliberately and watch over them with mine eyes!' 'How dost thou order thyself when thou goest in to one not of the nobles of thy tribe?' 'I lower mine eyes modestly and I salute first; I avoid what concerneth me not and I spare my words!' 'And how when thou goest in to thine equals?' 'I give ear to them when they speak and I do not assail them when they err!' 'When thou goest in to thy chiefs?' 'I salute without making any sign and await the reply: if they bid me draw near, I draw near, and if they draw off from me I withdraw!' 'How dost thou with thy wife?' Quoth Ahnaf, 'Excuse me from answering this, O Commander of the Faithful!'; but Mu'awiyah cried, 'I conjure thee inform me.' He said, 'I entreat her kindly and show her familiarity and am large in expenditure, for woman was created of a crooked rib.'[FN#270] 'And how dost thou when thou hast a mind to lie with her?' 'I bid her perfume herself and kiss her till she is moved to desire; then, should it be as thou knowest,[FN#271] I throw her on her back. If the seed abide in her womb I say, 'O Allah make it blessed and let it not be a wastrel, but fashion it into the best of fashions!'[FN#272] Then I rise from her to ablution and first I pour water over my hands and then over my body and lastly, I praise Allah for the joy He hath given me.' Said Mu'awiyah, 'Thou hast answered right well and now tell me what be thy requirements?' Said Ahnaf, 'I would have thee rule thy subjects in the fear of Allah and do even handed justice between them.' Thereupon Ahnaf rose to his feet and left the Caliph's presence, and when he had gone Maysun said, 'Were there but this man in Irak, he would suffice to it.' Then continued Nuzhat al-Zaman, ""And all this is a section of the chapter of good breeding, and know O King, that Muaykib was intendant of the public treasury during the Caliphate of Omar bin al-Khatt√°b,""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Sixty-third Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, ""Know, O King, that Mu'aykib was intendant of the public treasury during the Caliphate of Omar bin al-Khattab; and it so befel him that he saw Omar's son and gave him a dirham out of the treasury. Thereupon, quoth Mu'aykib, 'I returned to my own house, and while I was sitting there behold, a messenger came to me from Omar and I was afraid and went to him, and when I came into his presence, in his hand was the dirham I had given his son. He said to me, 'Woe to thee Mu'aykib! I have found somewhat concerning thy soul.' I asked 'And what is that?'; and he answered, 'It is that thou hast shown thyself a foe to the followers of Mohammed (on whom be peace and salvation!) in the matter of this dirham, and thou wilt have to account for it on Resurrection Day.'[FN#273] And Omar also wrote a letter to Ab√∫ M√∫s√° al-Ash√°ri[FN#274] as follows, 'When these presents reach thee, give the people what is theirs and remit to me the rest.' And he did so. Now when Othman succeeded to the Caliphate, he wrote a like letter to Abu Musa, who did his bidding and sent him the tribute accordingly, and with it came Ziy√°d.[FN#275] And when Ziyad laid the tribute before Othman, the Caliph's son came in and took a dirham, whereupon Ziyad shed tears. Othman asked 'Why weepest thou?'; and Ziyad answered, 'I once brought Omar bin al-Khattab the like of this and his son took a dirham, where upon Omar bade snatch it from his hand. Now thy son hath taken of the tribute, yet I have seen none say aught to him or snatch the money from him.' Then Othman[FN#276] cried, 'And where wilt thou find the like of Omar?' Again Zayd bin Aslam relates of his father that he said, 'I went out one night with Omar till we approached a blazing fire. Quoth Omar, 'O Aslam, I think these must be travellers who are suffering from the cold. Come, let us join them.' So we walked on till we came to them and behold! we found a woman who had lighted a fire under a cauldron and by her side were two children, both a wailing. Said Omar, 'Peace be with you, O folk of light (for it was repugnant to him to say 'folk of fire'),[FN#277] what aileth you?' Said she, 'The cold and the night trouble us.' He asked, 'What aileth these little people that they weep?'; and she answered, 'They are hungry.' He enquired, 'And what is in this cauldron?'; and she replied, 'It is what I quiet them withal, and Allah will question Omar bin al- Khattab of them, on the Day of Doom.' He said, 'And what should Omar know of their case?' 'Why then,' rejoined she, 'should he manage people's affairs and yet be unmindful of them?' Thereupon Omar turned to me (continned Aslam) and cried, 'Come with us!' So we set off running till we reached the pay department of his treasury, where he took out a sack containing flour and a pot holding fat and said to me, 'Load these on my back!' Quoth I, 'O Commander of the Faithful, I will carry them for thee.' He rejoined, 'Wilt thou bear my load for me on the Day of Resurrection?' So I put the things on his back, and we set off, running, till we threw down the sack hard by her. Then he took out some of the flour and put it in the cauldron; and, saying to the woman, 'Leave it to me,' he began blowing the fire under the cauldron. Now he was a long bearded man[FN#278] and I saw the smoke issuing from between the hairs of his beard till the flour was cooked, when he took some of the fat and threw it in and said to the woman, 'Bed them while I cool it for them.' So they fell to eating till they had eaten their fill, and he left the rest with her. Then he turned to me and said, 'O Aslam, I see it was indeed hunger made them weep; and I am glad I did not go away ere I found out the cause of the light I saw.'‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Sixty-fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, ""It is related that Omar passed by a flock of sheep, kept by a Mameluke, and asked him to sell him a sheep. He answered, 'They are not mine.' 'Thou art the man I sought,' said Omar, and bought him and freed him; whereupon the slave exclaimed, 'O Allah, as thou hast bestowed on me the lesser emancipation; so vouchsafe me the greater!'[FN#279] It is also said that Omar bin al- Khattab was wont to give his servants sweet milk and himself eat coarse fare, and to clothe them softly and himself wear rough garments. He rendered unto all men their due, and exceeded in his giving to them. He once gave a man four thousand dirhams and added thereto a thousand, wherefore it was said to him, 'Why dost thou not increase to thy son as thou increasest to this man?' He answered, 'This man's father stood firm at the battle day of Ohod.'[FN#280] Al-Hasan relates that Omar once came back from foray with much money, and that Hafsah[FN#281] approached him and said, 'O Commander of the Faithful, the due of kinship!' 'O Hafsah!' replied he, 'verily Allah hath enjoined us to satisfy the dues of kinship, but not with the monies of the True Believers. Indeed, thou pleasest"" thy family, but thou angerest thy father.' And she went away trailing her skirts.[FN#282] The son of Omar said, 'I implored the Lord to show me my father one year after his death, till at last I saw him wiping the sweat from his brow and asked him, 'How is it with thee, O my father?' He answered, 'But for my Lord's mercy thy father surely had perished.' Then said Nuzhat al-Zaman, ""Hear, O auspicious King, the second division of the first chapter of the instances of the followers of the Apostle and other holy men. Saith Al Hasan al-Basr√≠,[FN#283] Not a soul of the sons of Adam goeth forth of the world without regretting three things,- failure to enjoy what he hath amassed, failure to compass what he hoped, failure to provide himself with sufficient viaticum for that hereto he goeth.[FN#284] It was said of Sufyan,[FN#285] 'Can a man be a religious and yet possess wealth?' He replied, 'Yes, so he be patient when grieved and be thankful when he hath received.' Abdullah bin Shadd√°d, being about to die, sent for his son Mohammed and admonished him, saying, 'O my son, I see the Summoner of Death summoning me, and so I charge thee to fear Allah both in public and private, to praise Allah and to be soothfastin thy speech, for such praise bringeth increase of prosperity, and piety in itself is the best of provision for the next world; even as saith one of the poets,

'I see not happiness lies in gathering gold; * The man most pious
is man happiest:
In truth the fear of God is best of stores, * And God shall make
the pious choicely blest.'
Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman, ""Let the King also give ear to these notes from the second section of the first chapter."" He asked her 'What be they?'; and she answered, ""When Omar bin Abd al-Az√≠z[FN# 286] succeeded to the Caliphate, he went to his household and laying hands on all that was in their hold, put it into the public treasury. So the Banu Umayyah flew for aid to his father's sister, F√°timah, daughter of Marwan, and she sent to him saying, 'I must needs speak to thee.' So she came to him by night and, when he had made her alight from her beast and sit down, he said to her, 'O aunt, it is for thee to speak first, since thou hast some thing to ask: tell me then what thou wouldst with me.' Replied she, 'O Commander of the Faithful, it is thine to speak first, for thy judgment perceiveth that which is hidden from the intelligence of others.' Then said Omar, 'Of a verity Allah Almighty sent Mohammed as a blessing to some and a bane to others; and He elected for him those with him, and commissioned him as His Apostle and took him to Himself,'‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Sixty-fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued thus, ""Said Omar, 'Verily Allah commissioned as His Apostle Mohammed (upon whom be the benediction of Allah and His salvation!), for a blessing to some and a bane to others; and He elected for him those with him and took him to Himself, leaving the people a stream whereof they might drink. After him Abu Bakr[FN#287] the Truth teller became Caliph and he left the river as it was, doing what was pleasing to Allah. Then arose Omar and worked a work and strove in holy war and strife where of none might do the like. But when Othman arose to power he diverted a streamlet from the stream, and Mu'awiyah in his turn diverted from it several streamlets; and without ceasing in like manner, Yezid and the Banu Marw√°n such as Abd al-Malik and Wal√≠d and Sulaym√°n[FN#288] drew away water from the stream, and the main course dried up, till rule devolved upon me, and now I am minded to restore the stream to its normal condition.' When Fatimah heard this, she said, 'I came wishing only to speak and confer with thee, but if this be thy word, I have nothing to say to thee.' Then she returned to the Ommiades and said to them, 'Now take ye the consequences of your act when ye allied yourselves by marriage with Omar bin al-Khattab.'[FN#289] And it is also said that when Omar was about to die, he gathered his children round him, and Maslamah[FN#290] bin Abd al-Malik said to him, 'O Prince of the Faithful, how wilt thou leave thy children paupers and thou their protector? None can hinder thee in thy lifetime from giving them what will suffice them out of the treasury; and this indeed were better than leaving the good work to him who shall rule after thee.' Omar looked at him with a look of wrath and wonder and presently replied, 'O Maslamah, I have defended them from this sin all the days of my life, and shall I make them miserable after my death? Of a truth my sons are like other men, either obedient to Almighty Allah who will prosper them, or disobedient and I will not help them in their disobedience. Know, O Maslamah, that I was present, even as thou, when such an one of the sons of Marwanwas buried, and I fell asleep by him and saw him in a dream given over to one of the punishments of Allah, to whom belong Honour and Glory! This terrified me and made me tremble, and I vowed to Allah, that if ever I came to power, I would not do such deeds as the dead man had done. I have striven to fulfil this vow all the length of my life and I hope to die in the mercy of my Lord.' Quoth Maslamah, 'A certain man died and I was present at his burial, and when all was over I fell asleep and I saw him as a sleeper seeth a dream, walking in a garden of flowing waters clad in white clothes. He came up to me and said: 'O Maslamah, it is for the like of this that rulers should rule.' Many are the instances of this kind, and quoth one of the men of authority, 'I used to milk the ewes in the Caliphate of Omar bin Abd al-Aziz, and one day I met a shepherd, among whose sheep I saw a wolf or wolves. I thought them to be dogs, for I had never before seen wolves; so I asked, 'What dost thou with these dogs?' 'They are not dogs, but wolves,' answered the shepherd. Quoth I, 'Can wolves be with sheep and not hurt them?' Quoth he, 'When the head is whole, the body is whole.'[FN#291] Omar bin Abd al-Aziz once preached from a pulpit of clay and, after praising and glorifying Allah Almighty, said three words as follows, 'O folk, make clean your inmost hearts, that your outward lives may be dean to your brethren, and abstain ye from the things of the world. Know that between us and Adam there is no one man alive among the dead. Dead are Abd al- Malik and those who forewent him, and Omar also shall die and those who forewent him.' Asked Maslamah, 'O Commander of the Faithful, an we set a pillow behind thee, wilt thou lean on it a little while?' But Omar answered, 'I fear lest it be a fault about my neck on Resurrection Day.' Then he gasped with the death rattle and fell back in a faint; whereupon Fatimah cried out, saying, 'Ho, Maryam! Ho, Muzahim![FN#292] Ho, such an one! Look to this man!' And she began to pour water on him weeping, till he revived from his swoon; and, seeing her in tears said to her, 'What causeth thee to weep, O Fatimah?' She replied, 'O Commander of the Faithful, I saw thee lying prostrate before us and thought of thy prostration in death before Almighty Allah, of thy departure from the world and of thy separation from us. This is what made me weep.' Answered he, 'Enough, O Fatimah, for indeed thou exceedest.' Then he would have risen, but fell down and Fatimah strained him to her and said, 'Thou art to me as my father and my mother, O Commander of the Faithful! We cannot speak to thee, all of us.' Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman to her brother Sharrkan and the four Kazis, ""Here endeth the second section of the first chapter.""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Sixty-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman said to her brother Sharrkan and the four Kazis, ""Here endeth the second section of the first chapter. And it so happened that Omar bin Abd al-Aziz wrote to the people of the festival at Meccah as follows, 'I call Allah to witness, in the Holy Month, in the Holy City and on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage,[FN#293] that I am innocent of your oppression and of his wrongs that doth wrong you, in that I have neither commanded this nor purposed it, neither hath any report of aught thereof hitherto reached me, nor have I compassed any knowledge thereof; and I trust that a cause for pardon will be found in that none hath authority from me to oppress any man, for I shall assuredly be questioned concerning every one oppress. And if any of my officers swerve from the right and act otherwise than the Holy Book and the Traditions of the Apostle do authorise, obey him not so that he may return to the way of righteousness.' He said also (Allah accept of him!), 'I do not wish to be relieved from death, because it is the supreme thing for which the True Believer is rewarded.' Quoth one of authority, 'I went to the Prince of the Faithful, Omarbin Abd al-Aziz, who was then Caliph, and saw before him twelve dirhams, which he ordered for deposit in the public treasury. So I said to him, 'O Commander of the Faithful, thou impoverishest thy children and reducest them to beggary having nothing whereon to live. An thou wouldst appoint somewhat by will to them and to those who are poor of the people of thy house, it were well.' 'Draw near to me,' answered he: so I drew near to him and he said, 'Now as for thy saying, 'Thou beggarest thy children; provide for them and for the poor of thy household,' it is without reason; for Allah of a truth will replace me to my children and to the poor of my house, and He will be their guardian. Verily, they are like other men; he who feareth Allah, right soon will Allah provide for him a happy issue, and he that is addicted to sins, I will not up hold him in his sin against Allah.' Then he summoned his sons who numbered twelve, and when he beheld them his eyes dropped tears and presently he said to them, 'Your Father is between two things; either ye will be well to do, and your parent will enter the fire, or ye will be poor and your parent will enter Paradise; and your father's entry into Paradise is liefer to him than that ye should be well to do.[FN#294] So arise and go, Allah be your helper, for to Him I commit your affairs!' Kh√°lid bin Safw√°n[FN#295] said, 'Y√∫suf bin Omar[FN#296] accompanied me to Hish√°m bin Abd al-Malik,[FN#297] and as I met him he was coming forth with his kinsmen and attendants. He alighted and a tent was pitched for him. When the people had taken their seats, I came up to the side of the carpet whereon he sat reclining and looked at him; and, waiting till my eyes met his eyes, bespoke him thus, 'May Allah fulfil His bounty to thee, O Commander of the Faithful, I have an admonition for thee, which hath come down to us from the history of the Kings preceding thee!' At this, he sat up whenas he had been reclining and said to me, 'Bring what thou hast, O son of Safwan!' Quoth I, 'O Commander of the Faithful, one of the Kings before thee went forth in a time before this thy time, to this very country and said to his companions, 'Saw ye ever any state like mine and say me, hath such case been given to any man even as it hath been given unto me?' Now there was with him a man of those who survive to bear testimony to Truth; upholders of the Right and wayfarers in its highway, and he said to him, 'O King, thou askest of a grave matter. Wilt thou give me leave to answer?' 'Yes,' replied the King, and the other said, 'Dost thou judge thy present state to be short lasting or ever lasting?' 'It is temporary,' replied the King. 'How then,' rejoined the man, 'do I see thee exulting in that which thou wilt enjoy but a little while and whereof thou wilt be questioned for a long while and for the rendering an account whereof thou shalt be as a pledge which is pawned?' Quoth the King, 'Whither shall I flee and what must I seek for me?' 'That thou abide in thy kingship,' replied the other, 'or else robe thee in rags[FN#298] and apply thyself to obey Almighty Allah thy Lord until thine appointed hour. I will come to thee again at daybreak.' Khalid bin Safwan further relates that the man knocked at the door at dawn and behold, the King had put off his crown and resolved to become an anchorite, for the stress of his exhortation. When Hish√°m bin Abd al-Malik heard this, he wept till his beard was wet, and, bidding his rich apparel be put off, shut himself up in his palace. Then the grandees and dependents came to Khalid and said, 'What is this thou hast done with the Commander of the Faithful? Thou hast troubled his pleasure and disturbed his life!' Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman, addressing herself to Sharrkan, ""How many instances of admonition are there not in this chapter! Of a truth I cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sitting,""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Sixty-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, speaking to Sharrkan, ""Know, O King, that in this chapter be so many instances of admonition that of a truth I cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sitting but, with length of days, O King of the age, all will be well."" There said the Kazis, ""O King, of a truth this damsel is the wonder of the world, and of our age the unique pearl! Never heard we her like in the length of time or in the length of our lives."" And they called down blessings on the King and went away. Then Sharrkan turned to his attendants and said, ""Begin ye to prepare the marriage festival and make ready food of all kinds."" So they forthright did his bidding as regards the viands, and he commanded the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees depart not until the time of the wedding banquet and of the unveiling of the bride. Hardly came the period of afternoon prayer when the tables were spread with whatso heart can desire or eye can delight in of roast meats and geese and fowls; and the subjects ate till they were satisfied. Moreover, Sharrkan had sent for all the singing women of Damascus and they were present, together with every slave girl of the King and of the notables who knew how to sing. And they went up to the palace in one body. When the evening came and darkness starkened they lighted candles, right and left, from the gate of the citadel to that of the palace; and the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees marched past before King Sharrkan, whilst the singers and the tire women took the damsel to dress and adorn her, but found she needed no adornment. Meantime King Sharrkan went to the Hammam and coming out, sat down on his seat of estate, whilst they paraded the bride before him in seven different dresses: after which they eased her of the weight of her raiment and ornaments and gave such injunctions as are enjoined upon virgins on their wedding nights. Then Sharrkan went in unto her and took her maidenhead;[FN#299] and she at once conceived by him and, when she announced it, he rejoiced with exceeding joy and commanded the savants to record the date of her conception. On the morrow he went forth and seated himself on his throne, and the high officers came in to him and gave him joy. Then he called his private secretary and bade him write a letter to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, saying that he had bought him a damsel, who excels in learning and good breeding and who is mistress of all kinds of knowledge. Moreover he wrote, ""There is no help but that I send her to Baghdad to visit my brother Zau al-Makan and my sister Nuzhat al-Zaman. I have set her free and married her and she hath conceived by me."" And he went on to praise her wit and salute his brother and sister together with the Wazir Dandan and all the Emirs. Then he sealed the letter and despatched it to his father by a post courier who was absent a whole month, after which time he returned with the answer and presented it in the presence. Sharrkan took it and read as follows, ""After the usual Bismillah, this is from the afflicted distracted man, from him who hath lost his children and home by bane and ban, King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, to his son Sharrkan. Know that, since thy departure from me, the place is become contracted upon me, so that no longer I have power of patience nor can I keep my secret: and the cause thereof is as follows. It chanced that when I went forth to hunt and course Zau al-Makan sought my leave to fare Hijaz wards, but I, fearing for him the shifts of fortune, forbade him therefrom until the next year or the year after. My absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Sixty-eighth night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Omar bin al-Nu'uman wrote in his letter, ""My absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month, and when I returned I found that thy brother and sister had taken somewhat of money and had set out with the pilgrim caravan for pilgrimage by stealth. When I knew this, the wide world narrowed on me, O my son! but I awaited the return of the caravan, hoping that haply they would come back with it. Accordingly, when the palmers appeared I asked concerning the twain, but they could give me no news of them; so I donned mourning for them, being heavy at heart, and in sleep I have no part and I am drowned in the tears of my eyes."" Then he wrote in verse,

""That pair in image quits me not one single hour, * Whom in my
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     heart's most honourable place I keep:
Sans hope of their return I would not live one hour, * Without my
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     dreams of them I ne'er would stretch me in sleep.""

The letter went on, ""And after the usual salutations to thee and thine, I command thee neglect no manner of seeking news of them for indeed this is a shame to us."" When Sharrkan read the letter he felt grief for his father and joy for the loss of his brother and sister. Then he took the missive and went in with it to Nuzhat al-Zaman who knew not that he was her brother, nor he that she was his sister, albeit he often visited her both by night and by day till the months were accomplished and she sat down on the stool of delivery. Allah made the child birth easy to her and she bare a daughter, whereupon she sent for Sharrkan and seeing him she said to him, ""This is thy daughter: name her as thou wilt."" Quoth he, ""It is usual to name children on the seventh day after birth.[FN#300]"" Then he bent over the child to kiss it and he saw, hung about its neck, a jewel, which he knew at once for one of those which Princess Abrizah had brought from the land of the Greeks. Now when he saw the jewel hanging from his babe's neck he recognised it right well, his senses fled and wrath seized on him; his eyes rolled in rage and he looked at Nuzhat al- Zaman and said to her, ""Whence hadst thou this jewel, O slave girl?"" When she heard this from Sharrkan she replied, ""I am thy lady, and the lady of all in thy palace! Art thou not ashamed to say to me Slave girl? I am a Queen, daughter of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman."" Hearing this, he was seized with trembling and hung his head earthwards,‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Sixty-ninth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan heard these words, his heart fluttered and his colour waxed yellow and he was seized with trembling and he hung his head earthwards, for he knew that she was his sister by the same father. Then he lost his senses; and, when he revived, he abode in amazement, but did not discover his identity to her and asked, O my lady, say, art thou in sooth the daughter of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman?"" ""Yes,"" answered she; and he continued, ""Tell me the cause of thy leaving thy sire and of thy being sold for a slave."" So she related to him all that had befallen her from beginning to end, how she had left her brother sick in the Sanctified City, Jerusalem, and how the Badawi had kidnapped her and had sold her to the trader. When Sharrkan heard this, he was certified of her being his sister on the sword side and said to himself, ""How can I have my sister to wife? By Allah, needs must I marry her to one of my chamberlains; and, if the thing get wind, I will declare that I divorced her before consummation and married her to my Chief Chamberlain."" Then he raised his head and sighing said, ""O Nuzhat al-Zaman, thou art my very sister and I cry: 'I take refuge with Allah from this sin whereinto we have fallen,' for I am Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman."" She looked at him and knew he spoke the truth; and, becoming as one demented, she wept and buffeted her face, exclaiming, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah! Verily have we fallen into mortal sin![FN#301] What shall I do and what shall I say to my father and my mother when they ask me, Whence hadst thou thy daughter?"" Quoth Sharrkan, ""It were meetest that I marry thee to my Chamberlain and let thee bring up my daughter in his house, that none may know thou be my sister. This hath befallen us from Almighty Allah for a purpose of his own, and nothing shall cover us but thy marriage with this Chamberlain, ere any know."" Then he fell to comforting her and kissing her head and she asked him, ""What wilt thou call the girl?"" ""Call her Kuzia Fak√°n,""[FN#302] answered he. Then he gave the mother in marriage to the Chief Chamberlain, and transferred her to his house with the child, which they reared on the laps of the slave girls, and fed with milk and dosed with powders. Now all this occurred whilst the brother, Zau al-Makan, still tarried with the Fireman at Damascus. One day there came to King Sharrkan a courier from his father, with a letter which he took and read and found therein, ""After the Bismillah know, O beloved King, that I am afflicted with sore affliction for the loss of my children: sleep ever faileth me and wakefulness ever assaileth me. I send thee this letter that, as soon as thou receivest it, thou make ready the monies and the tribute, and send them to us, together with the damsel whom thou hast bought and taken to wife; for I long to see her and hear her discourse; more especially because there hath come to us from Roumland an old woman of saintly bearing and with her be five damsels high bosomed virgins, endowed with knowledge and good breeding and all arts and sciences befitting mortals to know; and indeed tongue faileth me to describe this old woman and these who with her wend; for of a truth they are compendiums of perfections in learning and accomplishments. As soon as I saw them I loved them, and I wished to have them in my palace and in the compass of my hand; for none of the Kings owneth the like of them; so I asked the old woman their price and she answered, 'I will not sell them but for the tribute of Damascus.' And I, by Allah, did not hold this price exorbitant, indeed it is but little, for each one of them is worth the whole valuation. So I agreed to that and took them into my palace, and they remain in my possession. Wherefore do thou forward the tribute to us that the woman may return to her own country; and send to us the damsel to the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors; and, if she prevail over them, I will return her to thee accompanied by the tribute of Baghdad.""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Seventieth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Omar son of Al-Nu'uman said in his letter, ""And send to us the damsel to the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors and, if she prevail over them, I will return her to thee accompanied with the tribute of Baghdad."" As soon as Sharrkan knew the contents, he went in to his brother in law and said to him, ""Bring the damsel to whom I married thee;"" and when she came he showed her the letter and said, ""O my sister! what answer wouldst thou advise me make to this letter?"" Replied she, ""Seek advice from thyself!"" and presently added (for she yearned after her people and her native land), ""Send me together with my husband the Chamberlain, to Baghdad, that I may tell my father my tale and let him know whatso befel me with the Badawi who sold me to the merchant, and that I also inform him how thou boughtest me of the trader and gavest me in marriage to the Chamberlain, after setting me free."" ""Be it so,"" replied Sharrkan. Then Sharrkan took his daughter, Kuzia Fakan, and committed her to the charge of the wet nurses and the eunuchs, and he made ready the tribute in haste, bidding the Chamberlain travel with the Princess and the treasure to Baghdad. He also furnished him two travelling litters one for himself and the other for his wife. And the Chamberlain replied, ""To hear is to obey."" Moreover Sharrkan collected camels and mules and wrote a letter to his father and committed it to the Chamberlain; then he bade farewell to his sister, after he had taken the jewel from her and hung it round his daughter's neck by a chain of pure gold; and she and her husband set out for Baghdad the same night. Now it so happened that Zau al-Makan and his friend the Fireman had come forth from the hut in which they were, to see the spectacle, and they beheld camels and Bukhti[FN#303] dromedaries and b√¢t-mules and torches and lanterns alight; and Zau al-Makan enquired about the loads and their owner and was told that it was the tribute of Damascus going to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of the City of Baghdad. He then asked, ""Who be the leader of the caravan?"" and they answered, ""The Head Chamberlain who hath married the damsel so famous for learning and science."" Thereupon Zau al-Makan wept with bitter weeping and was minded of his mother and his father and his sister and his native land, and he said to the Stoker, ""I will join this caravan and, little by little, will journey homewards."" Quoth the Fireman, ""I would not suffer thee to travel single handed from the Holy City to Damascus, then how shall I be sure of thy safety when thou farest for Baghdad? But I will go with thee and care for thee till thou effectest thine object."" ""With joy and good will,"" answered Zau al-Makan. Then the Fireman get him ready for the journey and hired an ass and threw saddle bags over it and put therein something of provaunt; and, when all was prepared, he awaited the passage of the caravan. And presently the Chamberlain came by on a dromedary and his footmen about him. Then Zau al-Ma ken mounted the ass and said to his companion, ""Do thou mount with me."" But he replied, ""Not so: I will be thy servant."" Quoth Zau al-Makan, ""There is no help for it but thou ride awhile."" ""'Tis well,"" quoth the Stoker; ""I will ride when I grow tired."" Then said Zau al-Makan, ""O my brother, soon shalt thou see how I will deal with thee, when I come to my own folk."" So they fared on till the sun rose and,When it was the hour of the noonday sleep[FN#304] the Chamberlain called a halt and they alighted and reposed and watered their camels. Then he gave the signal for departure and, after five days, they came to the city of Ham√°h,[FN#305] where they set down and made a three days' halt;‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seventy-first Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they halted in the city of Hamah three days; they then fared forwards and ceased not travelling till they reached another city. Here also they halted three days and thence they travelled till they entered the province Diy√°r Bakr. Here blew on them the breezes of Baghdad, and Zau al-Makan bethought him of his father and mother and native land, and how he was returning to his sire without his sister: so he wept and sighed and complained, and his regrets grew on him, and he began improvising these couplets,

""Sweetheart! How long must I await by so long suffering teed? *
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    Nor cometh messenger to tell me where thou dost abide:
Ah me! in very sooth our meeting time was short enow: * Would
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    Heaven shorter prove to me the present parting-tide!
Now trend my hand and open my robe and thou within shall sight *
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    How wasted are the limbs of me and yet the waste I hide:
When say they 'Comfort take for loss of love' I but reply * 'By
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    Allah, till the Day of Doom no comfort shall betide!' ""

Thereupon said to him the Fireman, ""Leave this weeping and wailing, for we are near the Chamberlain's tent."" Quoth Zau al- Makan, ""Needs must I recite somewhat of verse; haply it may quench the fire of my heart."" ""Allah upon thee,"" cried the other, ""cease this lamentation till thou come to shine own country; then do what thou wilt, and I will be with thee wherever thou art."" Replied Zau al-Makan, ""By Allah! I cannot forbear from this!"" Then he turned his face towards Baghdad and the moon was shining brightly and shedding her light on the place, and Nuzhat al-Zaman could not sleep that night, but was restless and called to mind her brother and wept. And while she was in tears, he heard Zau al-Makan weeping and improvising the following distichs,

'Al-Yaman's[FN#306] leven-gleam I see, * And sore despair
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    despaireth me
For friend who erst abode wi' me * Crowning my cup with gladdest
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   gree:
It minds me o' one who jilted me * To mourn my bitter liberty.
Say sooth, thou fair sheet lightning! shall * We meet once more
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   in joy and glee?
O blamer! spare to me thy blame * My Lord hath sent this dule to
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    dree,
Of friend who left me, fain to flee; * Of Time that breeds
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    calamity:
All bliss hath fled the heart of me * Since Fortune proved mine
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    enemy.
He[FN#307] brimmed a bowl of merest pine, * And made me drain the
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    dregs, did he:
I see me, sweetheart, dead and gone * Ere I again shall gaze on
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   thee.
Time! prithee bring our childhood back, * Restore our happy
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    infancy,
When joy and safety 'joyed we * From shafts that now they shoot
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    at me!
Who aids the hapless stranger wight, * That nights in fright and
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    misery,
That wastes his days in lonely grief, * For 'Time's
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     Delight'[FN#308] no more must be?
Doomed us despite our will to bear * The hands of base bores cark
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     and care.""

When he ended his verse he cried out and fell down in a fainting fit. This is how it fared with him; but as regards Nuzhat al- Zaman, when she heard that voice in the night, her heart was at rest and she rose and in her joy she called the Chief Eunuch, who said to her, ""What is thy will?"" Quoth she, ""Arise and bring me him who recited verses but now."" Replied he, ""Of a truth I did not hear him""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Seventy-second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nuzhat Al-Zaman heard her brother reciting, she called the Chief Eunuch and said to him, ""Go, fetch me the man who is repeating this poetry!"" Replied he, ""Of a truth I heard him not and I wot him not and folks are all sleeping."" But she said, ""Whomsoever thou seest awake, he is the reciter."" So he went, yet found none on wake save the Stoker; for Zau al-Makan was still insensible, and when his companion saw the Eunuch standing by his head he was afraid of him. Then said the Eunuch, ""Art thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him?"" The Stoker fancied that the dame was wroth with the reciter; and, being afraid, he replied, ""By Allah, 'twas not I!"" Rejoined the Eunuch, ""Who then was the reciter?: point him out to me. Thou must know who it was, seeing that thou art awake."" The Fireman feared for Zau al- Makan and said in himself, ""Haply the Eunuch will do him some hurt""; so he answered, ""By Allah, I know not who it was."" Said the Eunuch, ""By Allah, thou liest, for there is none on wake here but thou! So needs must thou know him."" ""By Allah,"" replied the Fireman, ""I tell thee the truth!: some passer by, some wayfarer must have recited the verses and disturbed me and kept me awake; Allah requite him!"" Quoth the Eunuch, ""If thou happen upon him, point him out to me and I will lay hands on him and bring him to the door of our lady's litter[FN#309] or do thou take him with thine own hand."" Said the Fireman, ""Go thou back and I will bring him to thee."" So the Eunuch left him and went his ways; and, going in to his mistress, told her all this and said to her, ""None knoweth who it was; it must have been some passer by, some wayfarer."" And she was silent. Meanwhile, Zau al-Makan came to himself and saw that the moon had reached the middle Heavens; the breath of the dawn breeze[FN#310] breathed upon him and his heart was moved to longing and sadness; so he cleared his throat and was about to recite verses, when the Fire man asked him, ""What wilt thou do?"" Answered Zau al-Makan, ""I have a mind to repeat somewhat of poetry, that I may quench therewith the fire of my heart."" Quoth the other, ""Thou knowest not what befel me whilst thou wast a faint, and how I escaped death only by beguiling the Eunuch."" ""Tell me what happened,"" quoth Zau al-Makan. Replied the Stoker, ""Whilst thou wast aswoon there came up to me but now an Eunuch, with a long staff of almond tree wood in his hand, who took to looking in all the people's faces, as they lay asleep, and asked me who it was recited the verses, finding none awake but myself. I told him in reply it was some passerby, some wayfarer; so he went away and Allah delivered me from him; else had he killed me. But first he said to me, 'If thou hear him again, bring him to us.'"" When Zau al-Makan heard this he wept and said, ""Who is it would forbid me to recite? I will surely recite, befal me what may; for I am near mine own land and care for none."" Rejoined the Fireman, ""Thy design is naught save to lose thy life;"" and Zau al-Makan retorted, ""Needs must I recite verses."" ""Verily,"" said the Stoker, ""needs must there be a parting between me and thee in this place, albeit;I had intended not to leave thee, till I had brought thee to thy native city and reunited thee with thy mother and father. Thou hast now tarried with me a year and a half and I have never harmed thee in aught. What ails thee, then, that thou must needs recite verses, seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are asleep, for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue?"" But Zau al-Makan answered, ""I will not be turned away from my purpose.""[FN#311] Then grief moved him and he threw off concealment and began repeating these couplets,

""Stand thou by the homes and hail the lords of the ruined stead;
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  * Cry thou for an answer, belike reply to thee shall be
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   sped:
If the night and absence irk thy spirit kindle a torch * Wi'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   repine; and illuminate the gloom with a gleaming greed:
If the snake of the sand dunes hiss, I shall marvel not at all!
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   * Let him bite so I bite those beauteous lips of the
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   luscious red:
O Eden, my soul hath fled in despite of the maid I love: * Had I
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   lost hope of Heaven my heart in despair were dead.""
And he also improvised the two following distichs,

""We were and were the days enthralled to all our wills, *
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   Dwelling in union sweet and homed in fairest site:
Who shall restore the home of the beloved, where showed * Light
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    of the Place for aye conjoined with Time's
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    Delight?''[FN#312]

And as he ceased his verses, he shrieked three shrieks and fell senseless to the ground and the Fireman rose and covered him. When Nuzhat al-Zaman heard the first improvisation, she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and their whilome home; then she wept and cried at the Eunuch and said to him, ""Woe to thee! He who recited the first time hath recited a second time and I heard him hard by. By Allah, an thou fetch him not to me, I will assuredly rouse the Chamberlain on thee, and he shall beat thee and cast thee out. But take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently, and do him no hurt. If he refuse, hand to him this purse of a thousand diners, then leave him and return to me and tell me, after thou hast informed thyself of his place and his calling and what countryman he is. Return quickly and linger not.""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seventy-third Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman sent the Eunuch to make enquiries concerning the singer and said, ""Beware how thou come back to me and report, I could not find him."" So the Eunuch went out and laid about the people and trod in their tents, but found none awake, all being asleep for weariness, till he came to the Stoker and saw him sitting up, with his head uncovered. So he drew near and seizing him by the hand, said to him, ""It was thou didst recite the verses!"" The Fireman was afeard for his life and replied, ""No, by Allah, O chief of the people, it was not I!"" But the Eunuch said, ""I will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses, for I dread returning to my lady without him."" Now when the Fireman heard these words he feared for Zau al-Makan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the Eunuch, ""By Allah, it was not I, and I know him not. I only heard some passer by, some wayfarer, recite verses: so do not thou commit sin on me, for I am a stranger and come from the Holy City of Jerusalem; and Abraham, the friend of Allah, be with you all."" ""Rise up and fare with me,"" rejoined the Eunuch, ""and tell my lady this with thine own mouth, for I have seen none awake save thyself."" Quoth the Stoker, ""Hast thou not come and seen me sitting in the place where I now am, and dost thou not know my station? Thou wottest none can stir from his place, except the watchman seize him. So go thou to thy station and if thou again meet any one after this hour reciting aught of poetry, whether he be near or far, it will be I or some one I know, and thou shalt not learn of him but by me."" Then he kissed the Eunuch's head and spake him fair till he went away; but the Castrato fetched a round and, returning secretly, came and stood behind the Fireman, fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings. As soon as he was gone, the Stoker arose and aroused Zau al-Makan and said to him, ""Come, sit up, that I may tell thee what hath happened."" So Zau al-Makan sat up, and his companion told him what had passed, and he answered, ""Let me alone; I will take no heed of this and I care for none, for I am mine own country.""[FN#313] Quoth the Stoker, ""Why wilt thou obey thy flesh and the devil? If thou fear no one, I fear for thee and for my life, so Allah upon thee! recite nothing more of verses till thou come to thine own land. Indeed, I had not deemed thee so ill conditioned. Dost thou not know that this lady is the wife; of the Chamberlain and is minded to chastise thee for disturbing her? Belike, she is ill or restless for fatigue of the journey and the distance of the place from her home, and this is the second time she hath sent the Eunuch to look for thee."" However Zau al-Makan paid no heed to the Fireman's words but cried out a third time and began versifying with these couplets,

""I fly the carper's injury,* Whose carping sorely vexeth me:
He chides and taunts me, wotting not * He burns me but more
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    grievously.
The blamer cries 'He is consoled!' * I say, 'My own dear
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    land[FN#314] to see:'
They ask, 'Why be that land so dear?' * I say, 'It taught me in
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    love to be:'
They ask, 'What raised its dignity?' * I say, 'What made my
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    ignomy:'
Whate'er the bitter cup I drain, * Far be fro' me that land to
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     flee:
Nor will I bow to those who blame, * And for such love would deal
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     me shame.

Hardly had he made an end of his verses and come to a conclusion, when the Eunuch (who had heard him from his hiding place at his head) came up to him; whereupon the Fireman flea end stood afar off to see what passed between them. Then said the Eunuch to Zau al-Makan, ""Peace be with thee, O my lord!"" ""And on thee be peace,"" replied Zau al-Makan, ""and the mercy of Allah and His blessings!"" ""O my lord,"" continued the Eunuch‚Äî-And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,

When it was the Seventy-fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Eunuch said to Zau al-Makan, ""O my lord, I have sought thee these several times this night, for my mistress biddeth thee to her."" Quoth Zau al- Makan, ""And who be this bitch that seeketh for me? Allah curse her and curse her husband with her!""[FN#315] And he began to revile the Eunuch, who could make him no answer, because his mistress had charged him to do Zau al-Makan no hurt, nor bring him save of his own especial free will; and, if he would not accompany him, to give him the thousand diners. So the Castrato began to speak him fair and say to him, ""O my lord, take this purse and go with me. We will do thee no upright, O my son, nor wrong thee in aught; but our object is that thou bend thy gracious steps with me to my mistress, to receive her answer and return in weal and safety: and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news."" When Zau al- Makan heard this, he arose and went with the Eunuch and walked among the sleeping folk, stepping over them; whilst the Fireman followed after them from afar, and kept his eye upon him and said to himself, ""Alas the pity of his youth! Tomorrow they will hang him."" And he ceased not following them till he approached their station,[FN#316] without any observing him. Then he stood still and said, ""How base it will be of him, if he say it was I who bade him recite the verses!"" This was the case of the Stoker; but as regards what befel Zau al-Makan, he ceased not walking with the Eunuch till he reached his station and the Castrato went in to Nuzhat al-Zaman and said, ""O my lady, I have brought thee him whom thou soughtest, and he is a youth, fair of face and bearing the marks of wealth and gentle breeding."" When she heard this, her heart fluttered and she cried, ""Let him recite some verses, that I may hear him near hand, and after ask him his name and his condition and his native land."" Then the Eunuch went out to Zau al-Makan and said to him, ""Recite what verses thou knowest, for my lady is here hard by, listening to thee, and after I will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition."" Replied he, ""With love and gladness but, an thou ask my name, it is erased and my trace is unplaced and my body a waste. I have a story, the beginning of which is not known nor can the end of it be shown, and behold, I am even as one who hath exceeded in wine drinking and who hath not spared himself; one who is afflicted with distempers and who wandereth from his right mind, being perplexed about his case and drowned in the sea of thought."" When Nuzhat al-Zaman heard this, she broke out into excessive weeping and sobbing, and said to the Eunuch, ""Ask him if he have parted from one he loveth even as his mother or father."" The Castrato asked as she bade him, and Zau al-Makan replied, ""Yes, I have parted from every one I loved: but the dearest of all to me was my sister, from whom Fate hath separated me."" When Nuzhat al- Zaman heard this, she exclaimed, ""Allah Almighty reunite him with what he loveth!""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seventy-fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nuzhat al-Zaman heard his words she said, ""Allah reunite him with what he loveth!"" Then quoth she to the Eunuch, ""Tell him to let me hear somewhat anent his separation from his countrymen and his country."" The Eunuch did so, and Zau al-Makan sighed heavily and began repeating these couplets,[FN#317]

""Is not her love a pledge by all mankind confest? * The house
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    that hometh Hinda be forever blest'
Her love all levels; man can reck of naught beside; * Naught or
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   before or after can for man have zest
'Tis though the vale is paved with musk and ambergris * That day
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   when Hinda's footstep on its face is prest:
Hail to the beauty of our camp, the pride of folk, * The dearling
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   who en' Slaves all hearts by her behest:
Allah on 'Time's Delight' send large dropped clouds that teem *
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   With genial rain but bear no thunder in their breast.""
And also these,

""I vow to Allah if at home I sight * My sister Nuzhat al-Zamani
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   highs
I'll pass the days in joyance and delight * Mid bashful minions,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     maidens soft and white:
To sound of harps in various modes they smite * Draining the
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    bowl, while eyes rain lively light
'Neath half closed lids, a sipping lips red bright * By stream
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    bank flowing through my garden site.""

When he had finished his verse, Nuzhat al-Zaman lifted up a skirt of the litter curtain and looked at him. As soon as her eyes fell on his face, she knew him for certain and cried out, ""O my brother! O Zau al-Makan!"" He also looked at her and knew her and cried out, ""O my sister! O Nuzhat al-Zaman!"" Then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit. When the Eunuch saw this case, he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them, waited till they should recover. After a while they came to themselves, and Nuzhat al-Zaman rejoiced with exceeding joy: oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her, and she repeated these verses,

""Time sware my life should fare in woeful waste; * Forsworn art
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   Time, expiate thy sin in haste![FN#318]
Comes weal and comes a welcome friend to aid; * To him who brings
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   good news, rise, gird thy waist
I spurned old world tales of Eden bliss; * Till came I
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    Kausar[FN#319] on those lips

When Zau al-Makan heard this, he pressed his sister to his breast; tears streamed from his eyes for excess of joy and he repeated these couplets,[FN#320]

""Long I lamented that we fell apart, * While tears repentant
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    railed from these eyne;
And sware, if Time unite us twain once more, * 'Severance' shall
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    never sound from tongue of mine:
Joy hath so overwhelmed me that excess * Of pleasure from mine
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    eyes draws gouts of brine:
Tears, O mine eyes, have now become your wont * Ye weep for
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    pleasure and you weep for pine!""

They sat awhile at the litter door till she said to him, ""Come with me into the litter and tell me all that hath befallen thee, and I will tell thee what happened to me."" So they entered and Zau al-Maken said, ""Do thou begin thy tale."" Accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the Khan and what had happened to her with the Badawi; how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brother Sharrkan and had sold her to him; how he had freed her at the time of buying; how he had made a marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the King, their sire, had sent and asked for her from Sharrkan. Then quoth she, ""Praised be Allah who hath vouchsafed thee to me and ordained that, even as we left our father together, so together shall we return to him!"" And she added, ""Of a truth my brother Sharrkan gave me in marriage to this Chamberlain that he might carry me to my father. And this is what befel me from first to last; so now tell me how it hath fared with thee since I left thee."" Thereupon he told her all that had happened to him from beginning to end; and how Allah vouchsafed to send the Fireman to him, and how he had journeyed with him and spent his money on him and had served him night and day. She praised the Stoker for this and Zau al-Makan added, ""Of a truth, O my sister, this Fireman hath dealt with me in such benevolent wise as would not lover with lass nor sire with son, for that he fasted and gave me to eat, and he walked whilst he made me ride; and I owe my life to him."" Said she, ""Allah willing, we will requite him for all this, according to our power."" Then she called the Eunuch, who came and kissed Zau al- Makan's hand, and she said, ""Take thy reward for glad tidings, O face of good omen! It was thy hand reunited me with my brother; so the purse I gave thee and all in it are thine. But now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me."" The Castrato rejoiced and, going in to the Chamberlain, him to his mistress. Accordingly, he came in to his wife and finding Zau al-Makan with her, asked who he was. So she told him all that had befallen them both, first and last, and added, ""Know, O Chamberlain, that thou hast married no slave girl; far from it, thou hast taken to wife the daughter of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman for I am Nuzhat al- Zaman, and this is my brother, Zau al-Makan."" When the Chamberlain heard the story he knew it to be sooth, and its manifest truth appeared to him and he was certified that he was become King Omar bin al-Nu'uman's son in law, so he said to himself, "" 'Twill be my fate to be made viceroy of some province.""[FN#321] Then he went up to Zau al-Makan and gave him joy of his safety and reunion with his sister, and bade his servants forthwith make him ready a tent and one of the best of his own horses to ride. Thereupon said Nuzhat al-Zaman, ""We are now near our country and I would be left alone with my brother, that we may enjoy each other's company and take our fill of it ere we reach Baghdad; for we have been parted a long, long time."" ""Be it as thou biddest,"" replied the Chamberlain, and, going forth from them, sent them wax candles and various kinds of sweetmeats, together with three suits of the costliest for Zau al-Makan. Then he returned to the litter and related the good he had done and Nuzhat al-Zaman said to him, ""Bid the Eunuch bring me the Fireman and give him a horse to ride and ration him with a tray of food morning and evening, and let him be forbidden to leave us."" The Chamberlain called the Castrato and charged him to do accordingly; so he replied, ""I hear and I obey;"" and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the Stoker till he found him in the rear of the caravan, girthing his ass and preparing for flight. The tears were running adown his cheeks, out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from Zau al-Makan; and he was saying to himself, ""Indeed, I warned him for the love of Allah, but he would not listen to me; Oh would I knew what is become of him!"" Ere he had done speaking the Eunuch was standing by his head whilst the pages surrounded him The Fireman turned and seeing the Eunuch and the pages gathered around him became yellow with fear,‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Seventy-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Stoker girthed his ass for flight and bespake himself, saying, ""Oh would I knew what is become of him!""; ere he had done speaking the Castrato was standing by his head and his side muscles quivered for fear and he lifted up his voice and cried, ""Verily he knoweth not the value of the good offices I have done him! I believe he hath denounced me to the Eunuch (hence these pages et about me) and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime."" Then the effeminated one cried at him, saying, ""Who was it recited the verses? O liar! why didst thou say, 'I never repeated these couplets, nor do I know who repeated them;' when it was thy companion? But now I will not leave thee between this place and Baghdad, and what betideth thy comrade shall betide thee."" Quoth the Fireman, ""What I feared hath befallen me."" And he repeated this couplet,

""'Twas as I feared the coming ills discerning: * But unto Allah we are all returning.""

Then the Eunuch cried upon the pages, saying, ""Take him off the ass."" So they carried him along with the caravan, surrounded by the pages, as the white contains the black of the eye; and the Castrato said to them, ""If a hair of him be lost, you will be lost with it."" And he bade them privily treat him with honour and not humiliate him. But when the Stoker saw himself beset by the pages, he despaired of his life and turning to the Eunuch, said to him, ""O Chief, I am neither this youth's brother nor am I akin to him, nor is he sib to me; but I was a Fireman in a Hammam and found him cast out, in his sickness, on the dung heap."" Then the caravan fared on and the Stoker wept and imagined in himself a thousand things, whilst the Eunuch walked by his side and told him nothing, but said to him, ""Thou disturbedst our mistress by reciting verses, thou and this youth: but fear nothing for thy self;"" and kept laughing at him the while to himself. Whenever the caravan halted, they served him with food, and he and the Castrato ate from one dish.[FN#322] Then the Eunuch bade his lads bring a gugglet of sugared sherbet and, after drinking himself, gave it to the Fireman, who drank; but all the while his tears never dried, out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from Zau al-Makan and for what had befallen them in their strangerhood. So they both travelled on with the caravan, whilst the Chamberlain now rode by the door of his wife's litter, in attendance on Zau al-Makan and his sister, and now gave an eye to the Fireman; and Nuzhat al-Zaman and her brother occupied themselves with converse and mutual condolence; and they ceased not after this fashion till they came within three days' journey from Baghdad. Here they alighted at eventide and rested till the morning morrowed; and as they awoke and they were about to load the beasts, behold, there appeared afar off a great cloud of dust that darkened the firmament till it became black as gloomiest night.[FN#323] Thereupon the Chamberlain cried out to them, ""Stay, and your loading delay!""; then, mounting with his Mamelukes, rode forward in the direction of the dust cloud. When they drew near, suddenly appeared under it a numerous conquering host like the full tide sea, with flags and standards, drums and kettledrums, horsemen and footmen. The Chamberlain marvelled at this; and when the troops saw him, there detached itself from amongst them a plump of five hundred cavaliers, who fell upon him and his suite and surrounded them, five for one; whereupon said he to them, ""What is the matter and what are these troops, that ye do this with us?"" Asked they, ""Who art thou; and whence comest thou, and whither art thou bound?"" and he answered, ""I am the Chamberlain of the Emir of Damascus, King Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad and of the land of Khorasan, and I bring tribute and presents from him to his father in Baghdad."" When the horsemen heard his words they let their head kerchiefs fall over their faces and wept, saying, ""In very sooth King Omar is dead and he died not but of poison. So fare ye forwards; no harm shall befal you till you join his Grand Wazir, Dandan."" Now when the Chamberlain heard this, he wept sore and exclaimed, ""Oh for our disappointment in this our journey!"" Then he and all his suite wept till they had come up with the host and sought access to the Wazir Dandan, who granted an interview and called a halt and, causing his pavilion to be pitched, sat down on a couch therein and commanded to admit the Chamberlain. Then he bade him be seated and questioned him; and he replied that he was Chamberlain to the Emir of Damascus and was bound to King Omar with presents and the tribute of Syria. The Wazir, hearing the mention of King Omar's name, wept and said, ""King Omar is dead by poison, and upon his dying the folk fell out amongst themselves as to who should succeed him, until they were like to slay one another on this account; but the notables and grandees and the four Kazis interposed and all the people agreed to refer the matter to the decision of the four judges and that none should gainsay them. So it was agreed that we go to Damascus and fetch thence the King's son, Sharrkan, and make him Sultan over his father's realm. And amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet, Zau Al-Makan, for, quoth they, his name be Light of the Place, and he hath a sister Nuzhat al-Zaman highs, the Delight of the Time; but they set out five years ago for Al-Hijaz and none wotteth what is become of them."" When the Chamberlain heard this, he knew; that his wife had told him the truth of her adventures; and he grieved with sore grief for the death of King Omar, albeit he joyed with exceeding joy, especially at the arrival of Zau al-Makan, for that he would now become Sultan of Baghdad in his father's stead‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seventy-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan's Chamberlain heard of the death of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman he mourned, but he rejoiced because of his wife and her brother Zau al-Makan who would become Sultan of Baghdad in his father's stead. So he turned to the Wazir Dandan and said to him, ""Verily your tale is a wonder of wonders! Know, O Chief Wazir, that here, where you have encountered me, Allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions, for that His Almighty Will restoreth to you Zau al-Makan and his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman; whereby we will settle the matter as we easily can."" When the Minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said, ""O Chamberlain, tell me the tale of the twain and what befel them and the cause of their long absence."" So he repeated to him the whole story and told him that Nuzhat al-Zaman was his wife and related to him the adventures of Zau al-Makan from first to last. As soon as he had ended his tale, the Wazir sent for the Emirs and Wazirs and Chief Officers and acquainted them with the matter; whereat they rejoiced with great joy and wondered at the happy chance. Then they gathered in a body and went in to the Chamberlain and did their service to him, kissing the ground between his hands; and the Wazir Dandan also rose and went out to meet him and stood before him in honour. After this, the Chamberlain held on that day a Divan council; and he and the Wazir sat upon a throne, whilst all the Emirs and Grandees and Officers of State took their places before them, according to their several ranks.[FN#324] Then they melted sugar in rose water and drank, after which the Emirs sat down to hold council and permitted the rest of the host to mount and ride forward leisurely, till they should make an end of their debate and overtake them. So the officers kissed the ground between their hands and mounting, rode onwards, preceded by the standards of war. When the grandees had finished their conference, they took horse and rejoined the host; and the Chamberlain approached the Wazir Dandan and said, ""I deem it well to ride on before you, and precede you, that I may get ready a place for the Sultan and notify him of your coming and of your choosing him as Sultan over the head of his brother Sharrkan."" ""Aright thou reckest,"" answered the Wazir Then the Chamberlain rose up in haste and Dandan also stood up to do him honour and brought him presents, which he conjured him to accept. In similar guise did all the Emirs and Grandees and Officers of State, bringing him gifts and calling down blessings on him and saying to him, ""Haply thou wilt mention our case to Sultan Zau al-Makan and speak to him to continue us in our dignities.""[FN#325] The Chamberlain promised all they required and bade his pages be ready to march, whereupon the Wazir Dandan sent with him tents and bade the tent pitchers set them up at a day's journey from the city. And they did his bidding. Then the Chamberlain mounted and rode forward, full of joy and saying to himself, ""How blessed is this gurney!"", and indeed his wife was exalted in his eyes, she and her brother Zau al-Makan. They made all haste over their wayfare, till they reached a place distant a day's journey from Baghdad, where the Chamberlain called a halt for rest, and bade his men alight and make ready a sitting place for the Sultan Zau al-Makan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, while he rode forward with his Mamelukes and, alighting at a distance from Nuzhat al-Zaman's litter, commanded the eunuchs to ask leave of admission to the presence. They did so and she gave permission; whereupon he went in to her and conversed with her and her brother; and told them of the death of their father; and of Zau al-Makan, how the heads of the people had made him King over them in the stead of his sire; and he gave them joy of the kingdom. They both wept for their father and asked the manner of his being killed; but the Chamberlain answered, ""The news rests with the Wazir Dandan who will be here tomorrow leading all the host; and it only remaineth for thee, O King, to do what they counsel, since they have unanimously chosen thee Sultan; for if thou do not this, they will choose some one else and thou canst not be sure of thy life with another Sultan. Haply he will kill thee, or discord may befal between you twain and the kingdom pass out of the hands of both."" Zau al-Makan bowed his head awhile and then said, ""I accept this position;"" for indeed there was no refusing; and he was certified that the Chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and set him on the right way. Then he added, ""O my uncle, how shall I do with my brother Sharrkan?"" ""O my son,"" replied the Chamberlain, ""thy brother will be Sultan of Damascus and thou Sultan of Baghdad; so take heart of grace and get ready thy case."" Zau al-Makan accepted this and the Chamberlain presented him with a suit of royal raiment and a dagger[FN#326] of state, which the Wazir Dandan had brought with him; then leaving him he bade the tent pitchers choose a spot of rising ground and set up thereon a spacious pavilion, wherein the Sultan might sit to receive the Emirs and Grandees. Moreover he ordered the kitcheners to cook rich viands and serve them and he commanded the water carriers to dispose the water troughs. They did as he bade them and presently arose a cloud of dust from the ground and spread till it walled the horizon round. After awhile, the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of Baghdad and Khorasan, a conquering host like the full tide sea.‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Seventy-eighth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Chamberlain bade the tent pitchers set up a pavilion spacious enough to receive the subjects flocking to their Sultan, they planted a splendid Sh√°hmiy√°nah[FN#327] befitting Kings. And as they ended their labours behold, a dust cloud spired aloft and the breeze made it lift and beneath it showed a conquering host; and presently it appeared that this was the army of Baghdad and Khorasan preceded by the Wazir Dandan. And in it all rejoiced at the accession of the ""Light of the Place."" Now Zau al-Makan had donned robes of royal estate and girt himself with the sword of state: so the Chamberlain brought him a steed and he mounted surrounded by the Mamelukes and all the company from the tents on foot, to do him service, and he rode on until he came to the great pavilion, where he sat down and he laid the royal dagger across his thighs, whilst the Chamberlain stood in attendance on him and his armed slaves stationed themselves under the entrance awning of the Shahmiyanah, with drawn swords in their hands. Presently, up came the troops and the host and craved admission so the Chamberlain went in to Zau al-Makan and asked his leave whereupon he bade admit them, ten by ten. The Chamberlain acquainted them with the King's commands, to which they replied, ""We hear and we obey;"" and all drew up before the pavilion entrance. Then he took ten of them and carried them through the vestibule into the presence of Sultan Zau al-Makan, whom when they saw, they were awed; but he received them with most gracious kindness and promised them all good. So they gave him joy of his safe return and invoked Allah's blessings upon him after which they took the oath of fealty never to gainsay him in aught and they kissed ground before him and withdrew. Then other ten entered and he entreated them as he had entreated the ethers; and they ceased not to enter, ten by ten, till none was left but the Wazir Dandan. Lastly the Minister went in and kissed the ground before Zau al-Makan, who rose to meet him, saying, ""Welcome, O Wazir and sire sans peer! Verily, thine acts are those of a counsellor right dear, and judgement and foreseeing clear are in the hands of the Subtle of Lere."" Then bade he the Chamberlain forthwith go out and cause the tables to be spread and order all the troops thereto. So they came and ate and drank. Moreover the Sultan commanded his Wazir Dandan call a ten days' halt of the army, that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain. The Wazir obeyed the commands of the Sultan with submission and wished him eternity of glory and said, ""This needs must be!"" He then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days. They did as he bade them and, moreover, he gave them leave to divert themselves and ordered that none of the lords in waiting should attend upon the King for service during the space of three days. Then the Wazir went to the Sultan and reported all to him, and Zau al-Makan waited until nightfall, when he went in to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman and asked her, ""Dost thou know the cause of my father's murder or not?"" ""I have no knowledge of the cause,"" she answered, and drew a silken curtain before herself, whilst Zau al-Makan seated himself without the curtain and commanded the Wazir to the presence and, when he came, said to him, ""I desire thou relate to me in detail the cause of the killing of my sire, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman!"" ""Know then, O King,"" replied Dandan, ""that King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, when he returned to Baghdad from his chasing and hunting and entered the city, enquired for thee and thy sister, but could not find you and knew that you twain had gone on the Pilgrimage; whereat he was greatly grieved and much angered, and his breast was straitened and he abode thus half a year, seeking news of you from all who came and went but none could give him any tidings. Now while we were in attendance upon him one day, after a whole year had sped since ye were lost to his sight, lo! there came to us an ancient dame with signs of being a devotee, accompanied by five damsels, high bosomed virgins like moons, endowed with such beauty and loveliness as tongue faileth to describe; and, to crown their perfections of comeliness, they could read the Koran and were versed in various kinds of learning and in the histories of bygone peoples. Then that old woman sought audience of the King, and he bade admit her; whereupon she entered the presence and kissed the ground between his hands. I was then sitting by his side and he, seeing in her the signs of asceticism and devoutness, made her draw near and take seat hard by him. And when she had sat down she addressed him and said, 'Know, O King, that with me are five damsels, whose like no King among the Kings possesseth; for they are endowed with wit and beauty and loveliness and perfection. They read the Koran‚Äîand the Traditions and are skilled in all manner of learning and in the history of bygone races. They stand here between thy hands to do thee service, O King of the Age, and it is by trial that folk are prized or despised. 'Thy father, who hath found mercy;[FN#328] looked at the damsels and their favour pleased him; so he said to them, Let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before!'‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seventy-ninth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said unto King Zau al-Makan, ""Thy father, who hath found mercy, glanced at the damsels and their favour pleased him and he said to them, 'Let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before!' Thereupon one of them came forward and, kissing the ground before him, spake as follows[FN#329] 'Know, O King, that it behoveth one of good breeding to eschew impertinence and adorn himself with excellencies, and observe the Divine injunctions and avoid mortal sins; and to this he should apply himself with the assiduity of one who, if he stray therefrom, falleth into perdition; for the foundation of good breeding is virtuous behaviour. And know that the chief cause and reason of man's existence is the endeavour after life everlasting, and the right way thereto is the service of Allah. Wherefore it behoveth thee to deal beneficently with the people: and swerve not from this canon, for the mightier men are in dignity, the more their need of prudence and foresight; and indeed Monarchs need this more than the many, for the general cast themselves into affairs, without taking thought to the issue thereof. Be thou prodigal of thy life and thy good in the way of Allah, and know that, if an enemy dispute with thee, thou mayst dispute with him and refute him with proofs and be proof against him; but as for thy friend, there is none can judge between thee and him save righteousness and fair dealing. Choose, therefore, thy friend for thyself, after thou hast proved him. If he be of the brotherhood of futurity,[FN#330] let him be zealous in observing the externals of the Holy Law and versed in its inner meaning, as far as may be; and if he be of the brotherhood of the world, let him be free born, sincere, neither a fool nor a perverse, for the fool man is such that even his parents might well flee from him, and a liar cannot be a true friend. Indeed the word, Sidd√≠k[FN#331] ('friend') deriveth from Sidk ('truth') that welleth up from the bottom of the heart; and how can this be the case, when falsehood is manifest upon the tongue? And know, that the observance of the Law profiteth him who practiseth it: so love thy brother, if he be of this quality and do not cast him off, even if thou see in him that which irketh thee, for a friend is not I like a wife, whom one can divorce and re-marry: nay, his heart is like glass: once broken, it may not be mended. And Allah bless him who saith,

'Ware how thou hurtest man with hurt of heart; * 'Tis hard to win
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     thee back the heart offended:
For hearts indeed, whence love is alien made, * Like broken glass
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     may nevermore be mended.'

The maiden continued and concluded with pointing out to us what sages say, 'The best of brethren is he who is the most constant in good counsel; the best of action is that which is fairest in its consequence, and the best of praise is not that which is in the mouths of men. It is also said, 'It behoveth not the servant to neglect thanking Allah especially for two favours, health and reason.' Again it is said, 'Whoso honoureth himself, his lust is a light matter to him, and he who maketh much of his small troubles, Allah afflicteth him with the greater; he who obeyeth his own inclination neglecteth his duties and he who listeneth to the slanderer loseth the true friend. He who thinketh well of thee, do thou fulfill his thought of thee. He who exceedeth in contention sinneth, and he who against upright standeth not on ward, is not safe from the sword. Now will I tell thee somewhat of the duties of Kazis and judges. Know, O King, that no judgement serveth the cause of justice save it be given after proof positive, and it behoveth the judge to treat all people on the same level, to the intent that the great may not hunger for oppression nor the small despair of justice. Furthermore he should extract proof from the complainant and impose an oath upon the defendant; and mediation is admissible between Moslems, except it be a compromise sanctioning the unlawful or forbidding the lawful.[FN#332] If thou shalt have done aught during the day, of which thy reason is doubtful but thy good intention is proved, thou (O Kazi) shouldst revert to the right, for to do justice is a religious obligation and to return to that which is right is better than persistence in wrong. Then (O judge) thou shouldest study precedents and the law of the case and do equal justice between the suitors, withal fixing thine eyes upon the truth and committing thine affair to Allah (be He extolled and exalted!). And require thou proof of the complainant, and if he adduce evidence let him have due benefit of it; and if not, put the defendant to his oath; for this is the ordinance of Allah. Receive thou the testimony of competent Moslem witnesses, one against other, for Almighty Allah hath commanded judges to judge by externals, He Himself taking charge of the inner and secret things. It behoveth the judge also to avoid giving judge meet, whilst suffering from stress of pain or hunger,[FN#333] and that in his decisions between folk he seek the face of Allah Almighty for he whose intent is pure and who is at peace with himself, Allah shall guarantee him against what is between him and the people.' Quoth al-Zuhri,[FN#334] 'There are three things for which, if they be found in a Kazi, he should be deposed; namely, if he honour the base, if he love praise and if he fear dismissal. And Omar bin Abd al-Aziz once deposed a Kazi, who asked him, 'Why hast thou dismissed me? It hath reached me,' answered Omar, 'that thy converse is greater than thy condition.' It is said also that Iskandar[FN#335] said to his Kazi, 'I have invested thee with this function and committed to thee in it my soul and mine honour and my manliness; so do thou guard it with thy sense and thine understanding.' To his Cook he said, 'Thou art the Sultan of my body; so look thou tender it as thine own self.' To his Secretary he said, 'Thou art the controller of my wit: so do thou watch over me in what thou writest for me and from me.'"" Thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward.‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eightieth Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said to Zau al-Makan, ""Thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward and, kissing the ground seven times before the King thy father, spake as follows, 'The sage Lukm√°n[FN#336] said to his son, 'There be three who are known only in three several cases; the merciful man is unknown save in time of wrath, the brave only in battle, and thy friend in time of need.' It is said that the oppressor shall be depress though by people praised, and that the oppress is at rest though by people blamed. Quoth Allah Almighty,[FN#337] 'Assuredly deem not that those who rejoice in what they have done, and who love to be praised for what they have not done, shall escape reckoning of punishment: indeed there is reserved for them a grievous penalty.' And he said[FN#338] (on whom be salvation and salutation!), 'Works are according to intention and to each man is attributed that which he intendeth.' He said also, 'In the body is a part which being sound the rest is sound, and which being unsound the whole is unsound.' And this is the heart. Now this heart is the most marvellous of what is in man, since it is that which ordereth his whole affair: If covetise stir in it, desire destroyeth him, and if affliction master it, anguish slayeth him; if anger rage in it, danger is hard upon him; if it be blest with contentment, he is safe from discontent; if fear surprise it, he is full of mourning; and if calamity overtake it, affliction betideth him. If a man gain the use of wealth, peradventure he is diverted thereby from the remembrance of his Lord; if poverty choke him his heart is distracted by woe, or if disquietude waste his heart, weakness causeth him to fall. Thus, in any case, nothing profiteth him but that he be mindful of Allah and occupy himself with gaining his livelihood in this world and securing his place in the next. It was asked of a certain sage, 'Who is the most ill conditioned of men?'; and he answered, 'The man whose lusts master his manhood and whose mind soareth over high, so that his knowledge dispreadeth and his excuse diminisheth; and how excellently saith the poet,

Freest am I of all mankind fro' meddling wight * Who, seeing
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    others err, self error ne'er can sight:
Riches and talents are but loans to creature lent, * Each wears
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    the cloak of that he bears in breast and sprite:
If by mistaken door attempt on aught thou make, * Thou shalt go
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    wrong and if the door be right, go right!'

Continued the maiden, 'As for anecdotes of devotees, quoth Hisham bin Bashar, 'I asked Omar bin Ubayd, What is true piety?'; and he answered, 'The Apostle of Allah (to whom be salutation and salvation!) hath explained it when he sayeth, The pious is he who forgetteth not the grave nor calamity and who preferreth that which endureth to that which passeth away; who counteth not the morrow as of his days but reckoneth himself among the dead.' And it is related that Abu Zarr[FN#339] used to say, Want is dearer to me than wealth, and unheal is dearer to me than health.' Quoth one of the listeners, 'May Allah have mercy on Abu Zarr!'. For my part, I say, 'Whoso putteth his trust in the goodness of the election of Almighty Allah should be content with that condition which Allah hath chosen for him.' Quoth one of the Companions of the Prophet, 'Ibn Abi Aufa[FN#340] once prayed with us the dawn prayer. When he had done, he recited, 'O Thou Enwrapped!'[FN#341] till he came to where Allah saith, 'When there shall be a trumping on the trumpet,' and fell down dead. It is said that Sabit al-Banani wept till he well nigh lost his eyes. They brought him a man to medicine him who said to him, 'I will cure thee, provided thou obey my bidding' Asked Sabit, 'In what matter?' Quoth the leach, 'In that thou leave weeping!' 'What is the worth of mine eyes?', rejoined Sabit, 'if they do not weep?' Quoth a man to Mohammed bin Abdillah, 'Exhort thou me!'""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eighty-first Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said to Zau al-Makan, ""Thus spake the second hand maid to the King who hath found mercy, Omar bin al-Nu'uman. 'Quoth a man to Mohammed bin Abdillah, Exhort thou me!' 'I exhort thee,' replied he, 'to be a self ruler, an abstainer in this world, and in the next a greedy slave.' 'How so?' asked the other and Mohammed answered, 'The abstinent man in this world conquereth both the world that is and the world to come.' And quoth Ghaus bin Abdillah, 'There were two brothers among the sons of Israel, one of whom said to the other, 'What be the most perilous[FN#342] thing thou hast done?' Replied the brother, 'I once came upon a nest of young birds; so I took out one and threw it back into the nest; but among the chickens were some which drew apart from it. This is the most perilous thing I ever did; now what be the most perilous thing thou hast ever done?' He rejoined, 'When I arise for prayer I am fearful that it is only for the sake of the reward.' Now their father heard these words and exclaimed, 'O Allah, an say they sooth take them to Thyself!' It was declared by one of the wise men, 'Verily, these were of the most virtuous of children.' Quoth Sa'√≠d bin Jubayr,[FN#343] 'I was once in company with Fuzalah bin 'Ubaydand said to him, 'Exhort thou me!, Replied he, 'Bear in mind these two necessaries, Shun syntheism[FN#344] and harm not any of Allah's creatures.' And he repeated these two couplets,

'Be as thou wilt, for Allah still is bounteous Lord, * And care
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    dispeller dread not therefore bane and ban
To two things only never draw thee nigh, nor give * Partner to
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    Allah trouble to thy brother man.'
And how well saith the poet,

'An thou of pious works a store neglect * And after death meet
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     one who did collect,
Thou shalt repent thou diddest not as he, * Nor madest ready as
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     he did elect.'

Then the third damsel came forward, after the second had with drawn, and said, 'Of a truth, the chapter of piety is exceeding wide; but I will mention what occurreth to me thereof, concerning the pious of old. Quoth a certain holy man, 'I congratulate myself in death, though I am not assured of rest therein, save that I know death interveneth between a man and his works; so I hope for the doubling of good works and the docking off of ill works.' And Ita'a al Salami, when he had made an end of an exhortation, was wont to tremble and grieve and weep sore; and as they asked him why he did this he answered, 'I desire to enter upon a grave matter, and it is the standing up before Almighty Allah to do in accordance with my exhortation.' In similar guise Zayn al-Abid√≠n,[FN#345] son of Al-Husayn, was wont to tremble when he rose to pray. Being asked the cause of this, he replied, 'Know ye not before whom I stand and whom I address?' It is said that there lived near Sufy√°n al-Thauri[FN#346] a blind man who, when the month of Ramazan came, went out with the folk to pray,[FN#347] but remained silent and hung back. Said Sufyan, 'On the Day of Resurrection he shall come with the people of the Koran and they will be distinguished by increase of honour from their fellows.' Quoth Sufyan, 'Were the soul established in the heart as befitteth, it would fly away for joy and pining for Paradise, and for grief and fear of hell-fire.' It is related also of Sufyan Al-Thauri that he said, 'To look upon the face of a tyrant is a sin.' Then the third damsel retired and came for ward the fourth, who said, 'Here am I to treat of sundry traditions of pious men which suggest themselves to me. It is related that Bishr Barefoot[FN#348] said, 'I once heard Kh√°lid say, 'Beware of secret polytheism.' I asked, 'What may secret polytheism be?'; and he answered, 'When one of you in praying prolong his inclinations and prostrations till a cause of impurity[FN#349] come upon him.' And one of the sages said, 'Doing works of weal expiateth what is ill.' Quoth Ibrahim,[FN#350] 'I supplicated Bishr Barefoot to acquaint me with some theological mysteries; but he said, 'O my son, this knowledge it behoveth us not to teach to every one; of every hundred five, even as the legal alms upon money.' Said Ibrahim, 'I thought his reply excellent and approved of it and while I was praying behold, Bishr was also praying: so I stood behind him[FN#351] making the prayer bow till the Mu'ezzin called his call. Then rose a man of tattered appearance and said, O folk, beware of a truth which bringeth unweal, for there is no harm in a lie bringing weal,[FN#352] and in time of need no choice we heed: speech booteth not in the absence of good qualities even as silence hurteth not in the presence of good. Presently I saw Bishr drop a danik,[FN#353] so I picked it up and exchanged it for a dirham which I gave him. Quoth he, 'I will not take it.' Quoth I, 'It is perfectly lawful change'; but he rejoined 'I cannot take in exchange the riches of the present world for those of the future world.' It is related also that Bishr Barefoot's sister once went to Ahmad bin Hanbal""[FN#354]‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eighty-second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to bespeak Zau al-Makan on this wise, ""And quoth the maiden to thy father, 'Bishr Barefoot's sister once went to Ahmad bin Hanbal and said to him, 'O Imam of the Faith, we are a family that spin thread by night and work for our living by day; and oftentimes the cressets of the watch of Baghdad pass by and we on the roof spinning by their light. Is this forbidden to us?' Asked Ahmad:'Who are thou?' 'I am the sister of Bishr Barefoot,' answered she. Rejoined the Iman, 'O household of Bishr, I shall never cease to drink full draughts of piety from your hearts.' Quoth one of the sages, 'When Allah willeth well to His servant He openeth upon him the gate of action.' M√°lik bin Din√°r,[FN#355] when he passed through the bazar and saw aught he desired, was wont to say, 'O soul, take patience, for I will not accord to thee what thou desirest.' He said also (Allah accept him!), 'The salvation of the soul lies in resistance to it and its damnation in submission to it.' Quoth Mans√∫r bin Amm√°r,[FN#356] 'I made a pilgrimage and was faring Meccahwards by way of Cufa, and the night was overcast, when I heard a voice crying out from the deeps of the darkness saying, 'O Allah, I swear by Thy Greatness and Thy Glory, I meant not through my disobedience to transgress against Thee; for indeed I am not ignorant of Thee; but my fault is one Thou didst foreordain to me from eternity without beginning;[FN#357] so do Thou pardon my transgression, for indeed I disobeyed Thee of my ignorance!' When he had made an end of his prayer he recited aloud the verse, 'O true believers, save your souls and those of your families from the fire whose fuel is men and stones.'[FN#358] Then I heard a fall, but not knowing what it was I passed on. When the morning morrowed, as we went our way, behold, we fell in with a funeral train, followed by an old woman whose strength had left her. I asked her of the dead, and she answered, 'This is the funeral of a man who passed by us yesterday whilst my son was standing at prayer and after his prayers he recited a verse from the Book of Allah Almighty when the man's gall bladder burst and he fell dead.' Therewith the fourth damsel retired and the fifth came forward and said, 'I here will also repeat what occurreth to me regarding the acts of devotees in olden time. Maslamah bin Din√°r used to say, 'By making sound the secret thoughts, sins great and small are covered'; and, 'when the servant of Allah is resolved to leave sinning, victory cometh to him.' Also quoth he, 'Every worldly good which doth not draw one nearer to Allah is a calamity, for a little of this world distracteth from a mickle of the world to come and a mickle of the present maketh thee forget the whole of the future.' It was asked of Ab√∫ H√°zim,[FN#359] 'Who is the most prosperous of men?'; and he answered, 'Whoso spendeth his life in submission to Allah.' The other enquired, 'And who is the most foolish of mankind?' 'Whoso selleth his future for the worldly goods of others,' replied Abu Hazim. It is reported of Moses[FN#360] (on whom be peace!) that when he came to the waters of Midian he exclaimed, 'O Lord, verily I stand in need of the good which thou shalt send down to me.'[FN#361] And he asked of his Lord and not of his folk. There came two damsels and he drew water for them both and allowed not the shepherds to draw first. When the twain returned, they informed their father Shu'ayb (on whom be peace!) who said, 'Haply, he is hungry,' adding to one of them, 'Go back to him and bid him hither.' Now when she came to Moses, she veiled her face and said, 'My father biddeth thee to him that he may pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for us.' Moses was averse to this and was not willing to follow her. Now she was a woman large in the back parts, and the wind blowing upon her garment[FN#362] covered the hinder cheeks to Moses; which when Moses saw, he lowered his eyes and said to her, 'Get thee behind while I walk in front.' So she followed him till he entered the house of Shu'ayb where supper was ready.""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eighty-third Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, ""Now, quoth the fifth damsel to thy sire, 'When Moses (on whom be peace!) entered the home of Shu'ayb where supper was ready, Shu'ayb said to him, 'O Moses, I desire to pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for these two.' But Moses answered, 'I am of a household which selleth nothing of the fashion of the next world[FN#363] for what is on earth of gold and silver.' Then quoth Shu'ayb, 'O youth! nevertheless thou art my guest, and it is my wont and that of my forbears to honour the guest by setting food before him.' So Moses sat down and ate. Then Shu'ayb hired Moses for eight pilgrimages, that is to say, eight years, and made his wage marriage with one of his two daughters, and Moses' service to him was to stand for her dowry. As saith the Holy Writ of him, 'Verily I will give thee one of these my two daughters in marriage, on condition that thou serve me for hire eight pilgrimages: and if thou fulfil ten years, it is in thine own breast; for I seek not to impose a hardship on thee.'[FN#364] A certain man once said to one of his friends whom he had not met for many days, 'Thou hast made me desolate, for that I have not seen thee this long while.' Quoth the other, 'I have been distracted from thee by Ibn Shih√°b: dost thou know him?' Quoth his friend, 'Yes, he hath been my neighbour these thirty years, but I have never spoken to him.' He replied, 'Verily thou forgettest Allah in forgetting‚Äîthy neighbour! If thou lovedst Allah thou wouldst love thy neighbour. Knowest thou not that a neighbour hath a claim upon his neighbour,[FN#365] even as the right of kith and kin?' Said Huzayfah, 'We entered Meccah with Ibr√°h√≠m bin Adham, and Shak√≠k al-Balkh√≠ was also making a pilgrimage that year. Now we met whilst circumambulating the Ka'abah and Ibrahim said to Shakik, 'What is your fashion in your country?' Replied Shakik, 'When we are blest with our daily bread we eat, and when we hunger we take patience.' 'This wise,' said Ibrahim, 'do the dogs of Balkh; but we, when blest with plenty, do honour to Allah and when an hungered we thank Him.' And Shakik seated himself before Ibrahim and said to him, 'Thou art my master.' Also said Mohammed bin Imr√°n, 'A man once asked of H√°tim the Deaf[FN#366] 'What maketh thee to trust in Allah?' 'Two things,' answered he, 'I know that none save myself shall eat my daily bread, so my heart is at rest as to that; and I know that I was not created without the knowledge of Allah, and am abashed before Him.' Then the fifth damsel retired and the ancient dame came forward and, kissing the ground before thy father nine times, said, 'Thou hast heard, O King, what these all have spoken on the subject of piety; and I will follow their example in relating what hath reached me of the famous men of past times. It is said that the Imam al-Sh√°fi'√≠ departed the night into three portions, the first for study, the second for sleep and the third for prayer. The Imam Ab√∫ Han√≠fah[FN#367] was wont also to pass half the night in prayer. One

day a man pointed him out to another, as he walked by and remarked, 'Yonder man watcheth the whole night.' When he heard this Abu Hanifah said, 'I was abashed before Allah to hear myself praised for what was not in me'; so after this he used to watch the whole night. And one of the Sages hath said,

'Who seeketh for pearl in the Deep dives deep; * Who on high would hie robs his night of sleep.'

Al-Rab√≠ a relates that Al-Shafi'i used to recite the whole Koran seventy times during the month of Ramazan, and that in his daily prayers. Quoth Al-Shafi'i (Allah accept him!), 'During ten years I never ate my fill of barley bread, for fullness hardeneth the heart and deadeneth the wit and induceth sleep and enfeebleth one from standing up to pray.'[FN#368] It is reported of Abdullah bin Mohammed al-Sakr√° that he said, 'I was once talking with Omar and he observed to me, 'Never saw I a more God fearing or eloquent man than Mohammed bin Idris al-Shafi'i.' It so happened I went out one day with Al-H√°ris bin Lab√≠b al-Saff√°r, who was a disciple of Al-Muzani[FN#369] and had a fine voice and he read the saying of the Almighty, 'This shall be a day whereon they shall not speak to any purpose, nor shall they be permitted to excuse themselves.'[FN#370] I saw Al-Shafi'i's colour change; his skin shuddered with horripilation, he was violently moved and he fell down in a fainting fit When he revived he said, 'I take refuge with Allah from the stead of the liars and the lot of the negligent! O Allah, before whom the hearts of the wise abase themselves, O Allah, of Thy bene ficence accord to me the remission of my sins, adorn me with the curtain of Thy protection and pardon me my shortcomings, by the magnanimity of Thy Being!' Then I rose and went away. Quoth one of the pious, 'When I entered Baghdad, Al-Shafi'i was there. So I sat down on the river bank to make the ablution before prayer; and behold, there passed me one who said, 'O youth, make thy Wuzu-ablution well and Allah will make it well for thee in this world and in the next.' I turned and lo! there was a man behind whom came a company of people. So I hastened to finish my ablution and followed him. Presently, he turned and asked me, 'Say, dost thou want aught?' 'Yes,' answered I, 'I desire that thou teach me somewhat of that which Allah Almighty hath taught thee.' He said, 'Know then that whoso believeth in Allah shall be saved, and whoso jealously loveth his faith shall be delivered from destruction, and whoso practiseth abstinence in this world, his eyes shall be solaced on the morrow of death. Shall I tell thee any more?' I replied, 'Assuredly;' and he continued, 'Be thou of the world that is, heedless; and of the world to come, greediest. Be truthful in all thy dealings, and thou shalt be saved with the Salvationists.' Then he went on and I asked about him and was told that he was the Imam Al-Shafi'i. Al-Shafi'i was wont to remark, 'I love to see folk profit by this learning of mine, on condition that nothing of it be attributed to me.""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eighty-fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, ""The old woman bespake thy sire, saying, 'The Imam Al-Shafi'i was wont to remark, I love to see folk profit by this learning of mine on condition that nothing of it be attributed to me.' He also said, 'I never disputed with any one, but I would that Almighty Allah should give him the knowledge of the Truth and aid him to dispread it: nor did I ever dispute with anyone at all but for the showing forth of the Truth, and I reck not whether Allah manifest it by my tongue or by His.' He said also (whom Allah accept!), 'If thou fear to grow conceited of thy lore, then bethink thee Whose grace thou seekest and for what good thou yearnest and what punishment thou dreadest.' It was told to Abu Han√≠fah that the Commander of the Faithful, Ab√∫ Ja'afar al-Mans√∫r, had appointed him Kazi and ordered him a salary of ten thousand dirhams; but he would not accept of this; and, when the day came on which the money was to be paid him, he prayed the dawn prayer, then covered his head with his robe‚Äîand spoke not. When the Caliph's messenger came with the money, he went in to the Imam and accosted him, but he would not speak to him. So the messenger said, 'Verily this money is lawfully thine.' 'I know that it is lawfully mine,' replied he: 'but I abhor that the love of tyrants get a hold upon my heart.'[FN#371] Asked the other, 'If thou go in to them canst thou not guard thyself from loving them?' Answered Abu Hanifah, 'Can I look to enter the sea without my clothes being wet?' Another of Al-Shafi'i's sayings (Allah accept him!) is,

'Oh soul of me, an thou accept my rede, * Thou shalt be wealthy
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   and of grace entire:
Cast off ambitious hopes and vain desires, * How many a death was
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    done by vain desire!'

Among the sayings of Sufy√°n al-Thaur√≠, with which he admonished Ali bin al-Hasan al-Salami was, 'Be thou a man of truth and 'ware lies and treachery and hypocrisy and pride. Be not indebted save to Him who is merciful to His debtors; and let thine associate be one who shall dissociate thee from the world. Be ever mindful of death and be constant in craving pardon of Allah and in beseeching of Allah peace for what remaineth of thy life. Counsel every True Believer, when he asketh thee concerning the things of his faith; and beware of betraying a Believer, for whoso betrayeth a Believer, betrayeth Allah and His Apostle. Avoid dissensions and litigation; and leave that which causeth doubt in thee for things which breed no doubt:[FN#372] so shalt thou be at peace. Enjoin beneficence and forbid malevolence: so shalt thou be loved of Allah. Adorn thine inner man and Allah shall adorn thine outer man. Accept the excuse of him who excuseth self to thee and hate not any one of the Moslems. Draw near unto those who withdraw from thee and excuse those that misuse thee: so shalt thou be the friend of the Prophets. Let thine affairs, both public and private, be in Allah's charge, and fear Him with the fear of one who knoweth he is dead and who fareth towards Resurrection and Judgement stead between the hands of the Lord of Dread; and remember that to one of two houses thou art sped, either for Heavens eterne or to the Hell fires that burn.' Thereupon the old woman sat down beside the damsels. Now when thy father, who hath found mercy, heard their discourse, he knew that they were the most accomplished of the people of their time; and, seeing their beauty and loveliness and the extent of their wisdom and lore, he showed them all favour. Moreover, he turned to the ancient dame and treated her with honour, and set apart for her and her damsels the palace which had lodged Princess Abrizah, daughter of the King of Greece, to which he bade carry all the luxuries they needed. They abode with him ten days and the old woman abode with them; and, whenever the King visited them, he found her absorbed in prayer, watching by night and fasting by day; whereby love of her took hold upon his heart and he said to me, 'O Wazir, verily this old woman is of the pious, and awe of her is strong in my heart.' Now on the eleventh day, the King visited her, that he might pay her the price of the damsels; but she said to him, 'O King, know that the price of these maidens surpasseth the competence of men; indeed I seek not for them either gold or silver or jewels, be it little or much.' Now when thy father heard these words he wondered and asked her, 'O my lady and what is their price?'; whereto she answered, 'I will not sill them to thee save on condition that thou fast, watching by night a whole month, and abstaining by day, all for the love of Allah Almighty; and, if thou do this, they are thy property to use in thy palace as thou please.' So the King wondered at the perfection of her rectitude and piety and abnegation; she was magnified in his eyes and he said, 'Allah make this pious woman to profit us!' Then he agreed with her to fast for a month as she had stipulated, and she said to him, 'I will help thee with the prayers I pray for thee and now bring me a gugglet of water.' They brought one and she took it and recited over it and muttered spells, and sat for an hour speaking in speech no one understood or knew aught thereof. Lastly she covered it with a cloth and, sealing it with her signet ring, gave it to thy sire, saying, 'When thou hast fasted the first ten days, break thy fast on the eleventh night with what is in this gugglet, for it will root out the love of the world from thy heart and fill it with light and faith. As for me, tomorrow I will go forth to my brethren, the Invisible[FN#373] Controuls, for I yearn after them, and I will return to thee when the first ten days are past. Thy father took the gugglet and arose and set it apart in a closet of his palace, then locked the door and put the key in his pocket. Next day the King fasted and the old woman went her ways.""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eighty-fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan thus continued to Zau al-Makan, ""Now when came the day for the Sultan's fast, the old woman went her ways. And after he had accomplished the ten days thereof, on the eleventh he opened the gugglet and drank what was therein and found it cordial to his stomach. Within the second ten days of the month the old woman returned, bringing sweetmeats wrapped in a green leaf, like no leaf of known tree. She went in to thy sire and saluted him; and, when he saw her, he rose to her saying, 'Welcome, O pious lady!' 'O King,' quoth she, 'the Invisible Controuls salute thee, for I told them of thee, and they rejoiced in thee and have sent thee their Halw√°,[FN#374] which is of the sweetmeats of the other world. Do thou break thy fast on it at the end of the day.' The King rejoiced at this with great joy, and exclaimed, 'Praised be Allah, who hath given me brethren of the Invisible World!' Thereupon he thanked the ancient dame and kissed her hands; and he honoured her and the damsels with exceeding honour. She went forth for the twenty days of thy father's fast at the end of which time she came to him and said, 'Know, O King, that I told the Invisible Controuls of the love which is between me and thee, and informed them how I had left the maidens with thee, and they were glad that the damsels should belong to a King like thee; for they were wont, when they saw them, to be strenuous in offering on their behalf prayers and petitions ever granted. So I would fain carry them to the Invisible Controuls that they may benefit by the breath of their favour, and peradventure, they shall not return to thee without some treasure of the treasures of the earth, that thou, after completing thy fast, mayst occupy thyself with their raiment and help thyself by the money they shall bring thee, to the extent of thy desires.' When thy sire heard her words, he thanked her for them and said, 'Except that I fear to cross thee, I would not accept the treasure or aught else; but when wilt thou set out with them?' Replied she, 'On the seven and twentieth night; and I will bring them back to thee at the head of the month, by which time thou wilt have accomplished thy fast and they will have had their courses and be free from impurity; and they shall become thine and be at thy disposal. By Allah, each damsel of them is worth many times thy kingdom!' He said, 'I know it, O pious lady!' Then quoth the old woman, 'There is no help but that thou send with them someone in thy palace who is dear to thee, that she may find solace and seek a blessing of the Invisible Controuls.' Quoth he, 'I have a Greek slave called Sophia, by whom I have been blessed with two children, a girl and a boy; but they were lost; years ago. Take her with thee that she may get the blessing'""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eighty-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, ""Quoth thy sire to the ancient woman when she demanded the handmaids of him, 'I have a Greek slave called Sophia, by whom I have been blest with two children, a girl and a boy, but they were lost years ago; so take her with thee, haply she may get the benediction and, belike, the Invisible Controuls will sue Allah for her that her two children may be restored to her.' 'Thou hast said well,' replied she; 'for that indeed was her grievousest want.' Thy sire gave not over finishing his fast till the old woman said to him, 'O my son, I am going to the Invisible Controuls; so bring me Sophia.' Accordingly, he summoned her and she came forthright, and he delivered her to the old woman who mixed her up with the other damsels. Then she went in to her chamber and bringing out a sealed cup, presented it to the Sultan saying, 'On the thirtieth day, do thou repair to the Hammam and when thou comest out, enter one of the closets in thy palace and drink what is in this cup. Then sleep, and thou shalt attain what thou seekest, and peace be with thee'! Thereat the King was glad and thanked her and kissed her hands. Quoth she, 'I commend thee to Allah's care;' whereat quoth he, 'And when shall I see thee again, O pious lady? In very sooth I love not to part with thee.' Then she called down blessings on him and departed with the five damsels and the Queen; whilst the King fasted after her departure other three days, till the month ended, when he arose and went to the Hammam and coming out shut himself up in a closet of his palace, commanding that none should go in to him. There, after making fast the door, he drank what was in the cup and lay down to sleep; and we sat awaiting him till the end of the day, but he did not come out and we said, 'Perchance he is tired with the bath and with watching by night and fasting by day; wherefore he sleepeth.' So we waited till next day; but still he did not come forth. Then we stood at the closet door and cried aloud so haply he might awake and ask what was the matter. But nothing came of that; so at last we lifted up the door;[FN#375] and, going in, found him dead, with his flesh torn into strips and bits and his bones broken.[FN#376] When we saw him in this condition it was grievous to us, and we took up the cup and found within its cover a piece of paper whereon was inscribed, 'Whoso doeth evil leaveth no regrets, and this be the reward of him who playeth traitor with the daughters of Kings and who debaucheth them; and we make known to all who fall upon this scroll that Sharrkan, when he came to our country, seduced our Queen Abrizah; nor did that suffice him but he must needs take her from us and bring her to you. Then he[FN#377] sent her away in company of a black slave who slew her, and we found her lying dead on the desert sward and thrown out to wild beasts. This be no kingly deed, and he who did this is requited with naught but what he merited. So do ye suspect none of having killed him, for no one slew him but the cunning witch, whose name is Zat al-Dawahi. And behold, I have taken the King's wife, Sophia, and have carried her to her father, Afridun King of Constantinople. Moreover, there is no help for it but that we wage war upon you and kill you and take your country from you, and ye shall be cut off even to the last man, nor shall a living soul be spared by Death nor one who bloweth fire with his breath, save he who Cross and Belt[FN#378] worshippeth.' When we read this paper, we knew that the ancient woman had beguiled us and carried out her plot against us: whereupon we cried aloud and buffeted our faces and wept sore when weeping availed us naught. And the troops fell out as to whom they should make Sultan; some would have thee, and others would have thy brother Sharrkan; and we ceased not to dispute about this for the space of a month, at the end of which certain of us drew together and agreed to repair to thy brother Sharrkan: so we set out and journeyed on till we fell in with thee. And such is the manner of the death of Sultan Omar bin al-Nu'uman!"" Now when the Wazir Dandan had made an end of his story, Zau al- Makan and his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman wept; and the Chamberlain, who wept also, said to Zau al-Makan, ""O King, weeping will avail thee naught; nor shall aught profit thee but that thou harden thy heart and strengthen thy stress and establish thy sovranty; for verily whoso leaveth the like of thee is not dead."" Thereupon Zau al-Makan gave over his weeping and caused his throne to be set up without the pavilion, and then commanded the army to pass in review order before him. And the Chamberlain sat by his side and all the armour-bearers[FN#379] behind him, whilst the Wazir Dandan and the rest of the Emirs and Grandees stood each in his individual stead. Then quoth King Zau al-Makan to the Minister Dandan, ""Inform me concerning my sire's treasures;"" and he replied, ""I hear and I obey;"" and gave him to know of the late King's hoards and monies, and what was in the treasury of amassed wealth and jewels, and acquainted him with other precious things. So Zau al-Makan opened his hand to the army, and gave a sumptuous robe of honour to the Wazir Dandan, saying, ""Thou continues"" in office. Whereupon Dandan kissed the ground before him and wished him long life. Then he bestowed dresses on the Emirs, after which he said to the Chamberlain, ""Bring out before me the tribute of Damascus that is with thee."" So he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels, when he took them and parted them all amongst the troops,‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eighty-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Zau al- Makan ordered the Chamberlain to bring out before him what he had brought of the tribute of Damascus; and, when he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels, he took them and parted them all amongst the troops, till nothing was left. And the Emirs kissed the ground before him and wished him long life, saying, ""Never saw we a King, who gave the like of these gifts."" Then all went away to their tents and when it was morning he gave orders for marching. So they marched for three days, till, on the fourth day, they drew near to Baghdad. When they entered the city, they found it decorated, and Zau al-Makan, the Sultan, went up to his father's palace and sat down on the throne, whilst the Emirs of the army and the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain of Damascus stood between his hands. Then he bade his private secretary write a writ to his brother Sharrkan, acquainting him with all that had passed, from first to last, and he concluded, ""As soon as thou hast read this letter, make ready thine affair and join us with thine army, that we may turn to Holy War upon the Infidels and take man bote for our father and wipe out the stain upon our honour."" Then he folded the letter and sealed it with his seal ring and said to the Minister Dandan, ""None shall carry this letter but thou; and it behoveth thee speak my brother fair and say to him, 'If thou have a mind to thy father's kingdom, it is thine, and thy brother shall be Viceroy for thee in Damascus; for to this effect am I instructed by him.'"" So the Wazir went down from before him and made ready for his march. Then Zau al-Makan bade set apart a magnificent house for the Fireman and furnished it with the best of furniture and long is the tale of that Fireman.[FN#380] Presently Zau al-Makan went out chasing and hunting and, as he was returning to Baghdad, one of the Emirs presented him with blood horses and with beauteous handmaids whose description the tongue evades. One of the damsels pleased him: so he went in unto her and knew her that night, and she conceived by him forthright. After a while, the Wazir Dandan returned from his journey, bringing him news of his brother Sharrkan and that he was then on his way to him, and said, ""It were fitting thou go forth to meet him."" Zau al- Makan replied, ""I hear and I consent;"" and riding forth with his Grandees a day's journey from Baghdad, he pitched his pavilions there awaiting his brother. Next morning appeared King Sharrkan amid the army of Syria, a horseman of might, a lion fierce in fight, a prow and doughty knight. As the squadrons drew nigh and the dust clouds came hard by and the troops rode up with banners on high, Zau al-Makan and those with him pushed forward to meet Sharrkan and his men; and when Zau al-Makan saw his brother, he desired to dismount, but Sharrkan conjured him not to do on this wise, and himself footed it, and walked a few paces towards him.[FN#381] As soon as he reached Zau al-Makan, the new Sultan threw himself upon him, and Sharrkan embraced him and wept with great weeping and the twain condoled with each other. Then they mounted and rode onward, they and their troops, till they reached Baghdad, where they alighted and went up to the royal palace and there they passed that night, and when next morning came, Zau al- Makan went forth and bade summon the troops from all parts, and proclaimed a Holy War and a Razzia.[FN#382] They then awaited the coming of the levies from each quarter of the kingdom, and every one who came they entreated with honour and promised him all manner of good; till in so doing a full month had sped, and the fighting men flocked to them in a continuous body. Then Sharrkan said to Zau al-Makan, ""O my brother, tell me thy history."" So he told him all that had befallen him from first to last, including the benevolent dealing of the Fireman with him. Asked Sharrkan, 'Hast thou requited his kindness?""; and he answered, ""O my brother! I have not rewarded him as yet, but Inshallah! I will recompense him whenas I return from this raid""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eighty-eighth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan asked his brother Zau al-Makan, ""Hast thou requited the Fireman for his kindness?""; and he answered, ""O my brother, I have not rewarded him as yet, but Inshallah! I will recompense him whenas I return from this raid and find time so to do."" Therewith Sharrkan was certified that his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, had told him the whole truth; but he concealed what had passed between them and offered his salutation to her by her husband the Chamberlain. She sent him back her greeting, calling down blessings on him and enquiring after her daughter Kuzia-Fakan, to which he replied that the maiden was well and in the best of health and safety. Where upon she praised Almighty Allah and gave him thanks. Then Sharrkan went to his brother to take counsel with him for departure; and Zau al-Makan said, ""O my brother, as soon as the army is complete and the Arabs have come in from all parts, we will march forth."" So he bade make ready the commissariat and prepare munitions of war and went in to his wife, who was now five months gone with child; and he put under her astrologers and mathematicians, to whom he appointed stipends and allowances. Then he set out three months after the arrival of the army of Syria, and as soon as the Arabs were come in and the troops were assembled from all directions; and, as he fared forth, he was followed by the warriors and the united host. Now the name of the General of the Daylam army was Rustam and that of the General of the army of the Turks[FN#383] Bahram. And Zau al- Makan marched in mid host and on his right was his brother Sharrkan, and on his left the Chamberlain his brother-in-law. So the squadrons broke up and pushed forward and the battalions and companies filed past in battle array, till the whole army was in motion. They ceased not to fare on for the space of a month, and each body dismounted at its own ground and there rested every week three days (for the host was great); and they advanced in this order till they came to the country of the Greeks. Then the people of the villages and hamlets and the poorer sort took fright at them and fled to Constantinople. But when King Afridun heard the tidings he arose and betook himself to Zat al-Dawahi, the same who had contrived the stratagem, and had travelled to Baghdad and had slain King Omar bin Al-Nu'uman; and who after carrying off her slaves and Queen Sophia, had returned with them all to her native land. Now when she had been restored to her son, the King of Greece, and felt herself safe, she said to King Hardub, ""Cool thine eyes; for I have avenged by blood the shame of thy daughter Abrizah, and have killed Omar bin al-Nu'uman and have brought back Sophia. So now let us go to the King of Constantinople and carry to him his daughter and acquaint him with what hath happened, that all of us be on guard and prepare our forces; and I will fare with thee to King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, for I opine that the Moslems will not await our attack."" Said Hardub, ""Tarry thou till they draw near our country, that we may make us ready meantime and assemble our power."" Accordingly they took to levying their forces and preparing for war, and, when the news of the Moslems' advance reached them, they were prepared for defence; and Zat al Dawahi had preceded them. Now when she and her son arrived at Constantinople, the King of Kings, Afridun, hearing of the approach of Hardub, King of the Greeks, came forth to meet him and asked how it was with him and the cause of his visit. So Hardub acquainted him with the cunning doings of his mother, Zat al-Dawahi, how she had slain the Moslem King and recovered from him Queen Sophia, and had said, ""The Moslems have assembled their forces and are on their way to attack us, wherefore it behoveth that we two join hands in single band and meet them."" Now King Afridun rejoiced in the return of his daughter and the killing of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; and he sent to all countries seeking succour and acquainting the folk with the cause of slaying the Moslem King. So the Nazarene troops flocked to him and three months were not past ere the army of the Greeks was complete, besides which there joined themselves to him Franks from all their lands, French, Germans[FN#384] and Ragusans,[FN#385] with men of Zara,[FN#386] Venetians, Genoese, and all the hosts of the Yellow Faces[FN#387]; and, when the gathering was at its full, earth was straitened on them by reason of their multitude. Then Afridun, the Great King, ordered a march; so they set out and ceased not to defile through the city for ten days. They fared on till they reached the Wady highs Al-Nu'uman, a broad sided vale hard by the Salt Sea, where they halted three days; and on the fourth they were about to set out again, when news came that the army of Al-Islam on them press, and the defenders of the faith of Mohammed, of Men the Best. So they halted in it other three days, and on the eighth they espied a dust cloud which towered till it walled the whole land; nor was an hour of the day past ere that dust began to drift and was torn to shreds in the lift, and pierced through its shades the starry radiance of lance and the white levee of blades. Presently there appeared beneath it the banners Islamitan and the ensigns Mahometan; the horsemen urged forward, like the letting loose of seas that surged, clad in mail, as they were mackerel-back clouds which the moon enveil; whereupon the two hosts clashed, like two torrents on each other dashed. Eyes fell upon eyes; and the first to seek combat singular was the Wazir Dandan, he and the army of Syria, numbering thirty thousand bridles, and with him were the General of the Turks, and the General of Daylam, Rustam and Bahram, amid twenty thousand horse, behind whom came the men from the shores of the Salt Sea, clad in iron mail, as they were full moons that past through a night o'ercast. Then the Nazarene host called out on Jesus and Mary, and the defiled[FN#388] Cross and they heaped themselves upon the Wazir Dandan and those with him of the Syrian host. Now all this was in pursuance of a stratagem devised by that ancient woman Zat al-Dawahi; for, before his departure, King Afridun had gone in to her and asked her, ""How shall I do and what plan shall I pursue?; it is thou hast caused this great distress to us;"" and she had answered, ""O great King and mighty Cohen![FN#389] I will teach thee a trick would baffle Iblis himself, though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hosts.""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eighty-ninth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, all this was a stratagem of the ancient woman, for that the King before his departure had gone to her and asked, ""How shall I do and what plan shall I pursue? it is thou hast caused this great distress to us!"" And she had answered, ""O great King and mighty Cohen, I will teach thee a trick would baffle the Devil himself though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hosts. It is that thou send fifty thousand men going down in ships, and sailing over the sea to the Mountain of Smoke; and there let them land and stir not till {he standards of Al-Islam come upon thee, when do thou up and at them. Then bid the troops from the seaward sally out upon the Moslems and take them in rear, whilst we confront them from the landward. So not one of them shall escape, and our sorrows shall tease and peace abide with us."" Now the counsel of this ancient woman commended itself to King Afridun, and he replied, ""Right is the recking thou reckest, O Princess of wits and recourse of Kings and Cohens warring for their blood wit!"" So when the army of Al-Islam came upon them in chat valley, before they knew of it the flames began to burn up the tents and the swords in men's bodies to make rents. Then hurried up the army of Baghdad and Khorasan who numbered one hundred and twenty thousand horse, with Zau al-Makan in the front of war. When the host of the Infidels that lay by the sea saw them, they sallied out against them and followed in their tracks; and when Zau al- Makan espied this he cried out to his men, ""Turn back to the Infidels, O People of the Chosen Apostle, and slay those who deny and hate the authority of the Compassionating, the Compassionate!"" So they turned and fought with the Christians. Then Sharrkan marched up with another corps of the Moslem host, some hundred thousand men, whilst the Infidels numbered nigh upon a thousand and six hundred thousand men. When the Moslems were united, their hearts were strengthened and they cried out, saying, ""Verily Allah hath pro mised us victory, and to the Infidels hath assigned defeat."" And they clashed together with sword and spear. Now Sharrkan tare through rank and row and raged among the masses of the foe, fighting so fierce a fight as to make children grey grow; nor did he cease tourneying among the infidel horde and working havoc among them with the keen edged sword, shouting ""Allaho Akbar!"" (Allah is Most Great) till he drove back the host to the coast. Then failed the force of the foe and Allah gave victory to the faith of Al-Islam, and folk fought folk, drunken without strong drink till they slew of the Infidels in this affair forty and five thousand, while of the Moslems but three thousand and five hundred fell. Moreover, the Lion of the Faith, King Sharrkan, and his brother, Zau al-Makan, slept not that night, but occupied themselves with congratulating their braves and with looking to the wounded and with assuring the army of victory and salvation and promise of reward in the world to come. Thus far concerning the Moslem; but as regards King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople and Sovran of Roum, and Zat Al-Dawahi, they assembled the Emirs of the host and said to them, ""Verily, we had worked our will and solaced our hearts, but our over confidence in our numbers, and that only, defeated us."" Then quoth to them the ancient one, the Lady of Calamities, ""In very sooth nought shall profit you, except ye draw you nigh unto the Messiah and put your trust in the True Belief, for, by the virtue of the Messiah, the whole strength of the Moslem host lieth in that Satan, King Sharrkan."" ""Tomorrow,"" said King Afridun, ""I have resolved to draw up in battle array and to send out against them that redoubtable cavalier, L√∫k√° bin Shaml√∫t; for if King Sharrkan come forth as a champion to fight single handed, our man will slay him and will slay the other Moslem Knights, till not one is left. And I purpose this night to sacre you all with the Holy Incense."" When the Emirs heard these words they kissed the ground before him. Now the incense which he designated was the excrement of the Chief Patriarch, the denier, the defiler of the Truth, and they sought for it with such instance, and they so highly valued it that the high priests of the Greeks used to send it to all the countries of the Christians in silken wraps after mixing it with musk and ambergris. Hearing of it Kings would pay a thousand gold pieces for every dram and they sent for and sought it to fumigate brides withal; and the Chief Priests and the great Kings were wont to use a little of it as collyrium for the eyes and as a remedy in sickness and colic; and the Patriarchs used to mix their own skite[FN#390] with it, for that the skite of the Chief Patriarch could not suffice for ten countries.[FN#391] So, as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen, the horsemen ran to their spears full keen, and King Afridun,‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Ninetieth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen, the horsemen ran to their spears full keen and King Afridun summoned his chief Knights and Nobles and invested them with dresses of honour; and, drawing the sign of the cross on their brows, incensed them with the incense which as aforesaid was the skite of the Chief Patriarch, the Cohen, the Heresiarch. This incensing done, he called for Luka bin Shamlut, surnamed the Sword of the Messiah; and, after fumigating him and rubbing his palate with the Holy Merde, caused him to snuff it and smeared his cheeks and anointed his moustaches with the rest. Now there was no stouter champion in the land of Roum than this accursed Luka, nor any better at bending of bow or sway of sword or lunge with lance on the day of devoir; but he was foul of favour, for his face was as the face of an ass, his shape that of an ape and his look as the look of a malignant snake: his presence was grievouser than parting from the beloved make; and blacker than night was his blackness and more fetid than the lion was his breath for foulness; more crooked than a bow was his crookedness and grimmer than the leopard was his ugliness, and he was branded with the mark of the Infidels on face.[FN#392] After this he came up to King Afridun and kissed his feet and stood before him; and the King said to him, ""I desire thou go out against Sharrkan, King of Damascus, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman, and deliver us from this affliction."" Quoth Luka, ""Hearkening and obedience;"" and the King made the sign of the cross on his forehead and felt assured of help from Heaven being near hand. Then Luka went out from the presence and the accursed one mounted a sorrel horse; he was clad in a red robe and a hauberk of gold set with jewels, and he bore a trident spear, as he were Iblis the damned on the day of drewing out his hosts war to darraign. Then he rode forward, he and his horde of Infidels, even as though they were driving to the Fire, preceded by a herald, crying aloud in the Arabic tongue and saying, ""Ho, sect of Mohammed (upon whom be salutation and salvation!), let none of you come out but your champion Sharrkan, the Sword of Al-Islam, Lord of Damascus in Sh√°m[FN#393]!"" Nor had he made an end of speaking, when arose a tumult in the plain; all the people heard the strain and the whole moving bodies of the armies twain called to mind the Day of Complain. Then the cowards trembled and all necks turned towards the sound, and lo! it was King Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman. For when his brother, Zau al-Makan, saw that accursed one push out on the plain, and heard the pursuivant, he turned to Sharrkan and said to him, ""Of a surety they seek for thee."" Said he, ""Should it so be, 'twere most pleasing to me."" So when they made sure of the matter and heard the herald crying in the plain, ""Let none of you come out against me save Sharrkan,"" they knew this cursed Luka to be champion of the land of Roum who had sworn to sweep the earth clean of Moslems. Now he was one of the greatest of villains, a wretch who caused hearts to pain; and the DayIamites, Turks and Kurds dreaded his might and main. Presently Sharrkan crave at him like a lion angry grim, mounted on a courser like a wild gazelle flying snell and slim; and coming nigh to him made the spear he hent to shake as it were a darting snake, and recited these couplets,

""I have a sorrel steed, whose pride is fain to bear the rein, *
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     Shall give thee what thou likest not and make thee feel his
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     main:
I have a handy limber spear full bright and keen of point, * Upon
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     whose shaft the dam of Death her throny seat hath ta'en:
I have a trenchant glaive of Hind; and, when I bare its face * Of
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     scabbard"" veil, from out its brow the rays of levee rain.""

Luka understood not the sense of his speech nor did he apprehend the vehemence of the verse; but he smote his forehead with his hand, in honour of the Cross drawn thereon and kissed it; then he couched his throw spear and ran at Sharrkan. But first he tossed the javelin with one hand in air to such height that it was lost to the spectators' sight; and, catching it with the other hand as do the jugglers, hurled it at Sharrkan. It flew from his grasp like a shooting star and folk clamoured and feared for Sharrkan; but, as the spear flew near him, he put out his hand and caught it in full flight to the amazement of all who saw the sight. Then he shook it with the hand that took it till it was well nigh broken, and hurled it so high into the welkin that it disappeared from view. As it descended, he caught it again with the other hand, in less than the twinkling of an eye, and cried out from his heart core, saying, ""By the truth of Him who created the sevenfold skies, I will assuredly make this cursed wight a byword for mankind to despise!"" Then threw he the throw spear at Luka, who thought to do as Sharrkan had done and put forth his hand to trend it in mid flight; but Sharrkan prevented him, and sped at him a second throw spear which smote him and the point fell on his forehead, in the very centre of the sign of the Cross, and Allah hurried his soul to the Fire and Dwelling place dire.[FN#394] But when the Infidels saw Luka bin Shamlut fall slain, they buffeted their faces and they cried, ""Alas!"" and ""Woe worth the day!"" and called for aid upon the Abbots of the monasteries,‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Ninety-first Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Infidels saw Luka bin Shamlut fall slain, they buffeted their faces and cried, ""Alas!"" and ""Woe worth the day!"" and called upon the Abbots of the monasteries and cried, ""Where be the crosses?"" So the Religious offered up prayers and the Christians all drew together against Sharrkan; and, brandishing their scymitars and lances, rushed forward to the attack. Then army met army and breasts fell under hoof, whilst spear and sword ruled the day and forearms and wrists grew weak and the coursers seemed created without legs;[FN#395] nor did the herald of-war cease calling to fight, till arms were aweary and day took flight and night came on with darkness dight. So the two hosts drew apart, whilst every brave staggered like a drunken knave, for that with so much cut and thrust they strave; and the place was choked with the slain; fell were the wounds and the hurt knew not by whom they fell. Then Sharrkan joined his brother, Zau al-Makan, and the Chamberlain and the Wazir Dandan, and said to them, ""Verily Allah hath opened a door for the Infidels to fall, praised be the Lord of the Worlds one and all!"" Replied Zau al-Makan, ""Let us never cease to praise Allah, for that He hath dispelled trouble from the Arab and the Ajam. Indeed the folk, generation after generation, shall tell of thy derring do against the accursed Luka, the falsifier of the Evangel;[FN#396] of thy catching the throng spear in mid-flight, and how the enemy of Allah among men thou didst smite; and thy fame shall endure until the end of time."" Then said Sharrkan, ""Harkye, O grand Chamberlain and doughty Capitayne!"" and he answered, ""Adsum!""[FN#397] Quoth Sharrkan, ""Take with thee the Wazir Dandan and twenty thousand horse, and lead them seven parasangs towards the sea, and force the march till ye shall have come near the shore, and there remain only two parasangs between thee and the foe. Then ambush ye in the hollows of the ground till ye hear the tumult of the Infidels disembarking from their ships; and the war cry from every side strike your ear and ye know that the sabres have begun labour between us and them; and, whenso ye see our troops falling back, as if defeated, and all the Infidels following them, as well those in front as those from the seaward and the tents, do ye still lie in wait for them: but as soon as ye see the standard with the words, There is no god but the God, and Mohammed is God's Apostle (on whom be salutation and salvation!), then up with the green banner, and do your endeavour and fall on their rear and shout, 'Alla ho Akbar! Allah is most Great!' and circle round that they may not interpose between the retreating army and the sea."" He replied, ""To hear is to obey!""; and forthright they agreed upon this matter and they went forth. Now the Chamberlain took with himself the Wazir Dandan and twenty thousand men even as Sharrkan had commanded. As soon as dawned the morn, the troops sprung to horse when they had donned their armour gear and drawn the scymitar and slung the spear. Then the Christians dispread themselves over hill and dale and the Ecclesiasts[FN#398] cried out and all heads were bared, and those in the ships hoisted the Cross at their mast heads and began making for shore from every side, and landed their horses and get them ready for fight and fray, whilst the sword blades glittered bright and the javelins glanced like levee light on mail shirt white; and all joined fight and the grind mill of Death whirled round and ground those who fought from horse and aground: heads from bodies flew end tongues mute grew and eyes no vision knew. Scymitars strave with utmost strain and heads flew over the battle plain; gall bladders crave and wrists were shorn in twain; steeds plashed in pools of gore and beards were gripped right sore; the host of Al-Islam called out, saying, ""On the Prince of Mankind be blessings and peace, and to the Compassionate glory and praise, which ne'er shall cease, for His boons which aye increase;"" and the host of the Infidels shouted, ""Glory to the Cross and the Belt and the vine press juice, and the wine presser and the Priests and the Monks and the Festival of Palms and the Metropolitan!"" Now Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan held back and their troops gave way and feigned flight from before the enemy, while the Infidel array pressed hard upon them deeming them in rout, and made ready to foin and hew. Then the meiny of the Moslems raised their voices, reciting the first verses of the Chapter of the Cow,[FN#399] whilst the dead were trampled under hoofs of steeds, and the heralds of the Greeks cried out, ""Ho, servants of the Messiah! Ho, people of the True Faith! Ho, followers of the Primate![FN#400] Verily Divine grace upon you opes; for see, the hosts of Al Islam like birds with broken wings incline to elope! So turn ye not to them your backs, but let your swords cleave deep in their necks and hold not your hands from them, else are ye outcasts from the Messiah, Mary's son, who spoke even when a cradled one!""[FN#401] Now Afridun, King of Constantinople, deemed that the Infidels were victorious, knowing not that this was but a clever stratagem of the Moslems, and sent to King Hardub of Roum congratulations on success, adding, ""Availed us naught but the Holy Merde of the Arch Patriarch, whose fragrance exhaled from the beards and mustachios of the slaves of the Cross near and far; and I swear, by the Miracles of the Messiah; and by thy daughter Abrizah, the Nazarene, the Mariolater; and by the Waters of Baptism, that I will not leave upon the earth a single defender of Al- Islam! And to the bitter end will I carry out this plan."" So the messenger betook himself with the address to King Hardub, whilst the Infidels called to one another saying, ""Take we vengeance wreak for Luka!""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Ninety-second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Infidels called to one another, saying, ""Take we vengeance wreak for Luka!"" while Hardub King of Greece cried aloud, ""Ho, to our revenge for Abrizah!"" Thereupon King Zau al-Makan shouted ""Ho, servants of the Requiting King!: smite the children of denial and disobedience with the blanch of sword and the brown of spear!"" So the Moslems returned to the Infidels and plied them with the keen edged scymitar, whilst their herald cried aloud, ""Up, and at the foes of the Faith, all ye who love the Prophet Elect, with hope of salvation on the Day of Fear, to win favour of the Bountiful, the Forgiving One; for verily the Garden of Paradise is under the shadow of swords!"" And behold, Sharrkan and his men charged down upon the Infidels and cut off their retreat and wheeled and tourneyed among the ranks; when lo! a knight of goodly presence opened a passage through the army of Unbelievers and circled hither and thither amongst the Deniers, cutting and thrusting and covering the ground with heads and trunks, so that the Faithless feared him and their necks bent under his lunge and hew. He was girt with two swords, his glances and his brand, and he was armed with two lances, one of bamboo cane and the other his straight wand like shape; and his flowing hair stood him in stead of many warriors, even as saith the poet,

""Laud not long hair,[FN#402] except it be dispread * In two fold
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    locks, on day of fight and fray,
O'er youth who bears his lance 'twixt flank and thigh, * From
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     many a whis kered knight to win the day.""
And as singeth another,

""I say to him, what while he slings his sword, * 'For sword shall
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     serve those looks that sword like show!'
Says he, 'My sabre looks for those I love, * My sword for those
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     who sweets of love unknow!'""

When Sharrkan saw him, he said to him, ""I conjure thee by the Koran and the attributes of the Compassionate One, O Champion of the Champions! tell me who thou art: for verily by thy deeds this day thou hast pleased the Requiting King, whom one thing distracteth not from other thing; in that thou hast been discomforting the children of impiety and in rebellion revelling."" Then cried the Cavalier to him saying, ""Thou art he who madest brother covenant with me but yesterday: how quickly thou hast forgotten me!"" Thereupon he withdrew his mouth veil,[FN#403] so that what was hidden of his beauty was disclosed, and lo! it was none other than Zau al-Makan. Then Sharrkan rejoiced in his brother, save that he feared for him the rush of fighting and the crush of braves a smiting; and this for two reasons, the first, his tender age and exposure to the evil eye, and the second, that his safety was to the kingdom the greater of the two overshadowing wings. So he said to him, ""O King! thou riskest thy life, so join thy steed to mine; in very sooth I fear for thee from the foe; and better thou stint hazarding thyself forth of these squadrons, that we may shoot at the enemy thine unerring shaft."" Quoth Zau al-Makan, ""I desire to even thee in fray and I will not be niggard of myself before thee in the melay."" Then the host of Al-Islam, heaping itself upon the Infidels, girt them on all sides, warred on them a right Holy War, and brake the power of the children of impiety and pride and stowre. But King Afridun sighed when he saw the evil wreak that had fallen on the Greek, and they turned their backs from fight and addressed themselves to flight, making for the ships, when lo! there came out upon them from the seacoast another host, led by the Minister Dandan, the champion who was wont to make champions bite the dust, and to lay load on them with cut and thrust. Nor less came forth the Emir Bahram, Lord of the Provinces of Sham, amid twenty thousand horse doughty of arm; and the host of Al-Islam pressed them in front and on flank and wrought them grievous harm. Then a body of the Moslems turned against those who in the ships remained, and perdition on them rained, till they threw themselves into the main, and they slew of them many slain, more than a hundred thousand noblemen, nor was one of their champions, great or small, saved from bale and bane. Moreover, they took their ships, with all the money and treasure and cargo, save a score of keel, and the Moslems got that loot whose like was never gotten in by gone years; nor was such cut and thrust ever heard of by men's ears.[FN#404] Now amongst the booty were fifty thousand horses, besides treasure and spoil past reckoning and arithmetic, whereat the Moslems rejoiced with an exceeding joy for that Allah had given them victory and protection. Such was the case with them; but as regards the fugitive Infidels they soon reached Constantinople, whither the tidings preceded them that King Afridun had prevailed over the Moslems; so quoth the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, ""I know that my son Hardub, King of Roum, is no runagate and that he feareth not the Islamitic hosts, but will restore the whole world to the Nazarene faith."" Then she bade the Great King, Afridun, give command that the city be decorated, and the people held festival high and drank their wines drunkenly and knew not the decrees of Destiny. Now whilst they were in the midst of their rejoicings, behold, the raven of dule and downfall croaked over them, and up came the twenty fugitive ships wherein was the King of C√¶sarea. So King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, met them on the sea shore, and they told him all that had befallen them from the Moslem, and they wept sore and groaned and moaned; and rejoicing at weal was turned into dismay for unheal; and they informed him concerning Luka son of Shamlut, how calamity had betided him and how Death had shot him with his shaft. Thereat the horrors of Doomday rose upon King Afridun,[FN#405] and he knew that there was no making straight their crook. Then came up from them the sound of weeping and wailing; the city was full of men mourning and the keepers were keening, and sighs and cries were heard from all sides. And when King Hardub of Greece met King Afridun he told him the truth of the case and how the flight of the Moslems was by way of stratagem and deceit, and said to him, ""Look not to see any of the army, save those who have already reached thee."" When King Afridun heard these words he fell down in a fainting fit, with his nose under his feet; and, as soon as he revived, he exclaimed, ""Surely the Messiah was wroth with them that he caused the Moslems to prevail over them!"" Then came the Arch Patriarch sadly to the King who said to him, ""O our father, annihilation hath overtaken our army and the Messiah hath punished us!"" Replied the Patriarch, ""Grieve not nor feel concerned, for it cannot be but that one of you have sinned against the Messiah, and all have been punished for his offence; but now we will read prayers for you in the churches, that the Mohammeden hosts may be repelled from you."" After which the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, came to Afridun and said to him, ""O King, verily the Moslem hosts are many, and we shall never overcome them save by wile: wherefore I purpose to work upon them by guile and repair to this army of Al-Islam, haply I may win my wish of their leader and slay their champion, even as I slew his father. If my stratagem succeed in his case, not one of the host he leads shall return to his native land, for all are strong only because of him; but I desire to have some Christian dwellers of Syria, such as go out every month and year to sell their goods, that they may help me (for this they can do) in carrying out my plan."" Replied the King, ""Be it so whenever thou wilt."" So she bade fetch an hundred men, natives of Najr√°n,[FN#406] in Sham, and the King asked them, ""Have ye not heard what hath befallen the Christians with the Moslems?"" ""Yes,"" answered they; and he rejoined, ""Know ye that this woman hath devoted her life to the Messiah and purposeth to go forth with you, disguised as Monotheists and Mohammedans, to work out a device which shall profit us and hinder the Moslem from us: say, then, are ye also willing to devote yourselves to the Anointed and I will give you a quintal of gold?[FN#407] He of you who escapeth shall have the money, and him of you who dieth will the Messiah reward."" ""O King,"" replied they, ""we will devote our lives to the Messiah, and we will be thy sacrifice."" Thereupon the old woman took all she required of aromatic roots and placed them in water which she boiled over the fire till the black essence of them was extracted. She waited till the decoction was cold, then dipped the corner of a long kerchief therein and stained her face therewith. Moreover, she donned over her clothes a long gaberdine with an embroidered border and took in her hand a rosary, and afterwards went in to King Afridun, who knew her not, nor did any of his companions know her, till she discovered herself to them: and there was none in the assembly but who thanked and praised her for her cunning; and her son rejoiced and said, ""May the Messiah never fail thee!"" Thereupon she took with her the Syrian Christians, and set out for the army of Baghdad.‚Äî And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Ninety-third Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Afridun heard these words, he fell into a fainting fit with his nose under his feet; and, as soon as he revived, fear fluttered the scrotum[FN#408] below his belly and he complained to the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi. Now this accursed old woman was a witch of the witches, past mistress in sorcery and deception; wanton and wily, deboshed and deceptious; with foul breath, red eyelids, yellow cheeks, dull brown face, eyes bleared, mangy body, hair grizzled, back humped, skin withered and wan and nostrils which ever ran. But she had studied the scriptures of Al-Islam and had made the Pilgrimage to the Holy House of Meccah and all this that she might come to the knowledge of the Mohammedan ordinances and the miraculous versets of the Koran; and she had professed Judaism in the Holy City of Jerusalem[FN#409] for two years' space, that she might master the magic of men and demons; so that she was a plague of plagues and a pest of pests, wrong headed as to belief and to no religion fief. Now the chief reason of her sojourn with her son, King Hardub of Greece, was on account of the slave virgins at his court: for she was given to tribadism[FN#410] and could not exist without sapphism or she went mad: so if any damsel pleased her, she was wont to teach her the art of rubbing clitoris against clitoris and would anoint her with saffron[FN#411] till she fainted away for excess of volupty. Whoso obeyed her she was wont to favour and make her son incline towards her; but whoso repelled her she would contrive to destroy; and so she abode for a length of time. This was known to Marjanah and Rayh√°nah and Utrijah, the handmaids of Abrizah, and their Princess loathed the old woman and abhorred to lie with her, because of the rank smell from her armpits, the stench of her fizzles more fetid than carrion, and the roughness of her hide coarser than palm fibre. She was wont to bribe those who rubbed parts with her by means of jewels and instructions; but Abrizah held aloof from her and sought refuge with the Omnipotent, the Omniscient; for, by Allah, right well quoth the poet,

""Ho thou who grovellest low before the great * Nor over fording
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     lesser men dost blench
Who gildest dross by dirham gathering, * No otter scent disguises
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     carrion stench!

And now to return to the story of her stratagem and the woes of her working. Presently she departed, taking the chief Nazarenes with their hosts, and turned towards the army of the Moslems. Whereupon King Hardub went in to King Afridun and said to him, ""O King, we have no need of the Chief Patriarch nor of his prayers, but will consult my mother's counsel and observe what she will do with her craft unending against the Moslem hosts; for these are marching with all their power, they will soon be upon us and they will encircle us on all sides."" When King Afridun heard this, terror took hold upon his heart and he wrote letters, without stay or delay, to all the nations of the Nazarenes, saying, ""It behoveth none of the Messiahites or Cross knights to hold back, especially the folk of the strongholds and forts: but let them all come to us, foot and horse, women and children, for the Moslem hosts already tread our soil. So haste! haste ye! ere what we fear to us here appear."" Thus much concerning them; but regarding the work of the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi; when she went forth from the city with her suite, she clad them in the clothing of Moslem merchants, having provided herself with an hundred mules carrying stuffs of Antioch, such as goldwoven satins and royal brocades and so forth. And she had taken a letter from King Afridun to the following effect: ""These be merchantmen from the land of Sham who have been with us: so it besitteth none to do them harm or hindrance, nor take tax and tithe of them, till they reach their homes and safe places, for by merchants a country flourisheth, and these are no men of war nor of ill faith."" Then quoth the accursed Zat al-Dawahi to those with her, ""Verily I wish to work out a plot for the destruction of the Moslem."" Replied they, ""O Queen, command us whatso thou wilt; we are at thy disposal and may the Messiah never disappoint thy dealings!"" Then she donned a gown of fine white wool and rubbed her forehead, till she made a great mark as of a scar and anointed it with an ointment of her own fashion, so that it shone with prodigious sheen. Now the old hag was lean bodied and hollow eyed, and she bound her legs tightly round with cords[FN#412] just above her feet, till she drew near the Moslem camp, when she unwound them, leaving their marks deeply embedded in her ankles. Then she anointed the wheels with dragon's blood and bade her companions beat her with a severe beating, and set her in a chest and, quoth she, ""Cry abroad the Refrain of Unity,[FN#413] nor fear from it aught of damage!"" Replied they, ""How can we beat thee, who be our sovereign lady, Zat al-Dawahi, mother of the King we glory in?"" Then said she, ""We blame not nor deal reproach to him who goeth to the jakes, and in need evil becometh good deed. When ye have set me in the chest, take it and make it one of the bales and place it on mule back and fare forth with it and the other goods through the Moslem camp, and fear ye no blame. And if any of the Moslems hinder you, give up the mules and their lading and be take yourselves to their King, Zau al-Makan, and implore his protection saying, 'We were in the land of the Infidels and they took nothing from us, but wrote us a passport, that none shall do us hindrance or work our mischance.' If he ask you, 'What profit had ye of your property in the land of Roum?' answer him, 'We profited in the deliverance of a pious man, who had been bound down in an underground cell nigh fifteen years, crying out for help yet none helped him. Nay, the Infidels tortured him night and day. We knew not this; but, after we had tarried in Constantinople for some time, having sold our goods and bought others in their stead, we determined on and made ready for a return to our native land. We spent that night conversing about our journey and when day broke, we saw figured upon the wall a human form and as we drew nigh it, behold, it moved and said, 'O Moslems, is there amongst you one who is minded to woo the favour of the Lord of the three Worlds?'[FN#414] 'How so?' asked we; and the figure answered, 'Know that Allah hath made me speak to you, to the intent that your faith be fortified, and that your belief embolden you and that you may go forth of the country of the Infidels and repair to the Moslem host; for with them wones the Sword of the Com passionate One, of our Age the Champion, King Sharrkan, by whom He shall conquer Constantinople town and destroy the sect of the Nazarene. And when ye shall have journeyed three days, you will find an hermitage known as the Hermitage of the ascetic Matruhina[FN#415] and containing a cell; visit it with pure intent and contrive to arrive there by force of will, for therein is a Religious from the Holy City, Jerusalem, by name Abdullah, and he is one of the devoutest of mankind, endowed with the power of working saintly miracles[FN#416] such as dispel doubts and obscurity. Certain of the monks seized him by fraud and shut him up in a souterrain where he hath lain a long time. By his deliverance you will please the Lord of Faithful Men, for such release is better than fighting for the Faith.'"" Now when the ancient dame and those with her had agreed upon such words, she said, ""As soon as that which I impart shall reach the ears of King Sharrkan, say him further, 'Hearing this from that image we knew that the holy man'""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Ninety-fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, and those with her had agreed upon such words, she said, ""Now as soon as that which I impart shall reach the ears of King Sharrkan say him further, 'Hearing these words from that image we knew that the holy man was indeed of the chiefest devotees and Allah's servants of purest qualities; so we made three days' march till we came in sight of that hermitage, and then we went up to it and passed the day in buying and selling, as is the wont of merchants. As soon as day had departed our sight and night was come to darken light, we repaired to the cell wherein was the dungeon, and we heard the holy man, after chanting some verses of the Koran, repeat the following couplets,

'My heart disheartened is, my breast is strait, * And sinks my
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    soul in sea of bale and bate
Unless escape be near I soon shall die; * And Death were better
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     than this doleful strait:
O Lightning an thou light my home and folk, * An their still
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     brighter charms thy shine abate,
Say, what my path to meet them, being barred * By wars, and
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     barricado'd succour's gate?'

""When once ye have brought me into the Moslem camp, and I mix with them you shall see,"" the old woman continued, ""how I will make shift to beguile them and slay them all, even to the last man."" The Nazarenes hearing whet she said, kissed her hands and set her in the chest, after they had beaten her with a grievous beating in obedience to her commands, for they saw it was incumbent on them to do her bidding in this; then they all made for the Moslem host as hath erst been said. Such was the case with the damned hag, Zat al-Dawahi and her companions; but as regards the Mohammeden army, they indeed, after Allah had given them victory over their enemies and they had plundered everything in the ships of money and hoards, all sat down to converse with one another and Zau al-Makan said to his brother Sharrkan, ""Verily, Allah hath granted us to prevail because of our just dealing and discipline and concord amongst ourselves; wherefore continue, O Sharrkan, to obey my commandment, in submission to Allah (be He exalted and extolled!), for I mean to slay ten Kings in blood revenge for my sire, to cut the throat of fifty thousand Greeks and to enter Constantinople."" Replied Sharrkan, ""My life be thy ransom against death! Needs must I follow out the Holy War, though I wone many a year in their country. But I have, O my brother, in Damascus a daughter, named Kuzia Fakan, whom I love heartily for she is one of the marvels of the time and she will soon be of age.' Said Zau al-Makan, ""And I also have left my wife with child and near her time, nor do I know what Allah will vouchsafe me by her. But promise me, O my brother, that if Allah bless me with a son, thou wilt grant me thy daughter for wife to him, and make covenant with me and pledge me thy faith thereon."" ""With love and good will, replied Sharrkan; and, stretching out his hand to his brother, he said, If she bring thee a son, I will give him my daughter Kuzia Fakan, to wife."" At this Zau al-Makan rejoiced, and they fell to congratulating each other on the victory over the enemy. And the Wazir Dandan also congratulated the two brothers and said to them, ""Know, O ye Kings, that Allah hath given us the victory, for that we have devoted our lives to Him (be He exalted and ex tolled!); and we have left our homes and households; and it is my counsel that we follow up the foe and press upon him and harass him, so haply Allah shall enable us to win our wishes, and we shall destroy our enemies, branch and root. If it please you, do ye go down in these ships and sail over the sea, whilst we fare forward by land and bear the brunt of battle and the thrust of fight."" And the Minister Dandan ceased not to urge them to combat and repeated his words who said,

""To slay my foes is chiefest bliss I wist, * And on the courser's
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    back be borne a list;
Comes promising tryst a messenger from friend * Full oft, when
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    comes the friend withouten tryst.""
And these words of another,

""War for my mother (an I live) I'll take; * Spear for my brother;
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   scymitar for sire
With every shag haired brave who meets his death * Smiling, till
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   won from Doom his dear desire!""

And when the Wazir ended his verses, he said, ""Praise be to Him who aided us dear victory to uphold and who hath given us spoil of silver and fine gold!"" Then Zau al-Makan commanded the army to depart; and they fared on forcing their marches for Constantinople, till they came to a wide and spacious champaign, full of all things fair and fain, with wild cattle frisking and gazelles pacing to and fro across the plain. Now they had traversed great deserts and drink had been six days cut off from them, when they drew near this meadow and saw therein waters founting and ripe fruits daunting and that land as it were Paradise; for it had donned its adornments and decked itself.[FN#417] Gently waved the branches of its trees drunken with the new wine of the dew, and combined with the nectar of Tasnim the soft breathings of the morning breeze. Mind and gazer were confounded by its beauty, even as saith the poet,

""Behold this lovely garden! 'tis as though * Spring o'er its
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   frame her greeny cloak had spread.
Looking with fleshly eyne, thou shalt but sight * A lake whose
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    waters balance in their bed,
But look with spirit eyes and lo! shalt see * Glory in every
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   leaf o'erwaves thy head.""

And as another saith,

""The stream's a cheek by sunlight rosy dyed, * Whose down[FN#418]
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  is creeping shade of tamarisk stems
Round legs of tree trunks waveless roll in rings * Silvern, and
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   blossoms are the diadems.""

When Zau al-Makan saw this champaign, with its trees bowing and its flowers blooming and its birds warbling, he called to his brother Sharrkan and said, ""O my brother, verily in Damascus is naught the like of this place. We will not march from it save after three days, that we may take rest ourselves and that the army of Al-Islam may regain strength and their souls be fortified to encounter the blamed Infidels."" So they halted therein and while camping behold, they heard a noise of voices from afar, and Zau al-Makan asked the cause thereof, and was answered that a caravan of merchants from the Land of Syria had halted there to rest and that the Moslem troops had come on them and had haply seized something of the goods which they had brought from the country of the Infidels. After a while up came the merchants, crying out and appealing to the King for aidance. When Zau al- Makan saw this, he bade them be brought before him and, when in presence they said to him, ""O King, we have been in the country of the Infidels and they plundered us of nothing: why then do our brothers the Moslems despoil our goods, and we in their own land? Of a truth when we saw your troops, we went up to them and they robbed us of what we had with us and we have now reported to thee all that hath befallen us."" Thereupon they brought out to him the letter of the King of Constantinople, and Sharrkan read it and said, ""We will presently restore to you what hath been taken from you; but yet it behoveth you not to carry merchandise to the country of the Infidels."" Replied they, ""O our Lord, in very sooth Allah despatched us thither that we might win what Gh√°zi[FN#419] never won the like of, not even thou in all thy razzias."" Asked Sharrkan, ""What was it ye won?"" ""O King,"" answered they, ""we will not tell thee save in private; for if this matter be noised among the folk, haply it may come to the ears of some,[FN#420] and this will be the cause of our ruin and of the ruin of all Moslems who resort to the land of the Greeks."" Now they had hidden the chest wherein was the damned Zat al- Dawahi. So Zau al-Makan and his brother brought them to a private place, where they laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee, and wept till they made the two Kings weep.‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Ninety-fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Nazarenes who wore merchants' weed, when brought to a private place by Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan, laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee and wept till they made the two Kings weep and repeated to them all which had been taught by the old witch Zat al-Dawahi. Thereupon Sharrkan's heart yearned to the devotee and he was moved to ruth for him and was fired with zeal for the service of Almighty Allah. So quoth he to them, ""Did ye rescue this holy man or is he still in the hermitage?"" Quoth they, ""We delivered him and slew the hermit, fearing for our lives; after which we made haste to fly for dread of death; but a trusty man told us that in this hermitage are quintals of gold and silver and stones of price."" Then they fetched the chest and brought out the accursed old woman, as she were a cassia pod[FN#421] for excess of blackness and leanness, and she was laden with the same fetters and shackles. When Zau al-Makan and the bystanders saw her, they took her for a man of the best of Allah's devotees and surpassing in pious qualities, more especially because of the shining of her forehead for the ointment wherewith she had anointed her face. So Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan wept sore; then they rose up in honour and kissed her hands and feet, sobbing aloud: but she signed to them and said, ""Cease this weeping and hear my words. Hereat they dried their tears in obedience to her bidding, and she said, ""Know ye both that I was content to accept what my Lord did unto me, for I kenned that the affliction which befel me was a trial from Him (be He exalted and extolled!); and whoso hath not patience under calamity and tribulation, for him there is no coming to the delights of Paradise. I had indeed supplicated Him that I might return to my native land, not as a compensation for the sufferings decreed to me, but that I might die under the horse hoofs of warriors fighting for the Faith who, being slain in fray, live again without suffering death.""[FN#422] Then she repeated the following couplets,

""Our Fort is Tor,[FN#423] and flames the fire of fight: * Moses
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    art thou and this is time for aid:
Cast down thy rod, 'twill swallow all they wrought, * Nor dread
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    for men their ropes be vipers made.[FN#424]
For Chapters read on fight day lines of foes, * And on their
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    necks 'grave versets[FN#425] wi' thy blade!""

When the old woman had ended her verse, her eyes overflowed with tears and her forehead under the unguent shone like gleaming light, and Sharrkan rose and kissed her hand and caused food be brought before her: but she refused it, saying, ""I have not broken my fast by day for fifteen years; and how should I break it at such a time when my Lord hath been bountiful to me in delivering me from the captivity of the Infidels and removing from me that which was more grievous to me than torment of fire? I will wait till sun down."" So when it was nightfall, Sharrkan and Zau al-Makan came and served her with food and said, ""Eat, O ascetic!"" But she said, ""This is no time for eating; it is the time for worshipping the Requiting King."" Then she stood up in the prayer niche and remained praying till the night was spent; and she ceased not to do after this fashion for three days and nights, sitting not but at the time of the Sal√°m or salutation[FN#426] ending with several prayers. When Zau al- Makan saw her on this wise, firm belief in her get hold of his heart and he said to Sharrkan, ""Cause a tent of perfumed leather to be pitched for this Religious, and appoint a body servant to wait upon him."" On the fourth day she called for food; so they brought her all kinds of meats that could seduce the sense or delight the sight; but of all this she would eat only a scone with salt. Then she again turned to her fast and, as the night came, she rose anew to pray; when Sharrkan said to Zau al-Makan, ""Verily, this man carrieth renunciation of the world to the extreme of renouncing, and, were it not for this Holy War, I would join myself to him and worship Allah in his service, till I came before His presence. And now I desire to enter his tent and talk with him for an hour."" Quoth Zau al-Makan, ""And I also: tomorrow we sally forth to fight against Constantinople, and we shall find no time like the present."" Said the Wazir Dandan, ""And I no less desire to see this ascetic; haply he will pray for me that I find death in this Holy War and come to the presence of my Lord, for I am aweary of the world."" So as soon as night had darkened, they repaired to the tent of that witch, Zat al-Dawahi; and, seeing her standing to pray, they drew near her and fell a weeping for pity of her; but she paid no heed to them till midnight was past, when she ended her orisons by pronouncing the salutation. Then she turned to them and after wishing them long life, asked them ""Wherefore come ye?"", whereto they answered, ""O thou holy man! diddest thou not hear us weep around thee?"" She rejoined, ""To him who standeth in the presence of Allah, remaineth no existence in time, either for hearing any or for seeing aught about him."" Quoth they, ""We would have thee recount to us the cause of thy captivity and pray for us this night, for that will profit us more than the possession of Constantinople."" Now when she heard their words she said, ""By Allah, were ye not the Emirs of the Moslems, I would not relate to you aught of this at any time; for I complain not but to Allah alone. However, to you I will relate the circumstances of my captivity. Know, then, that I was in the saintly City of Jerusalem with certain ecstatics and inspired men, and did not magnify myself among them, for that Allah (be He exalted and extolled!) had endowed me with humility and abnegation, till I chanced to go down to the sea one night and walked upon the water. Then entered into me pride; whence I know not, and I said to myself, 'Who like me can walk the water?' And my heart from that time hardened and Allah afflicted me with the love of travel. So I journeyed to Roum land and visited every part for a whole year, and left no place but therein I worshiped Allah. When I came to this spot,[FN#427] I clomb the mountain and saw there an hermitage, inhabited by a monk called Matrubina, who, when he sighted me, came out and kissed my hands and feet and said, 'Verily, I have seen thee since thou enteredst the land of the Greeks, and thou hast filled me with longing for the land of Al-Islam.' Then he took my hand and carried me into that hermitage, and brought me to a dark room; and, when I entered it unawares, he locked the door on me and left me there forty days, without meat or drink; for it was his intent to kill me by delay. It chanced one day, that a Knight called Dakian√∫s[FN#428] came to the hermitage, accompanied by ten squires and his daughter Tam√°sil, a girl whose beauty was incom parable. When they entered that hermitage, the monk Matruhina told them of me, and the Knight said, 'Bring him out, for surely there is not on him a bird's meal of meat.' So they opened the door of the dark room and found me standing in the niche, praying and reciting the Koran and glorifying Allah and humbling myself before the Almighty. When they saw me in this state Matrohina exclaimed, 'This man is indeed a sorcerer of the sorcerers!'; and hearing his words, they all came in on me, Dakianus and his company withal, and they beat me with a grievous beating, till I desired death and reproached myself, saying, 'This is his reward who exalteth himself and who prideth himself on that which Allah hath vouchsafed to him, beyond his own competence! And thou, O my soul, verily self esteem and arrogance have crept into thee. Dost thou not know that pride angereth the Lord and hardeneth the heart and bringeth men to the Fire?' Then they laid me in fetters and returned me to my place which was the dungeon under ground. Every three days, they threw me down a scone of barley bread and a draught of water; and every month or two the Knight came to the hermitage. Now his daughter Tamasil had grown up, for she was nine years old when I first saw her, and fifteen years passed over me in captivity, so that she had reached her four and twentieth year. There is not in our land nor in the land of the Greeks a fairer than she, and her father feared lest the King take her from him; for she had vowed herself to the Messiah and rode with Dakianus in the habit of a cavalier, so that albeit none might compare with her in loveliness, no one who saw her knew her for a woman. And her father had laid up his monies in this hermitage, every one who had aught of price or treasured hoard being wont to deposit it therein; and I saw there all manner of gold and silver and jewels and precious vessels and rarities, none may keep count of them save Almighty Allah. Now ye are worthier of these riches than those Infidels; so lay hands on that which is in the hermitage and divide it among the Moslems and especially on fighters in the Holy War. When these merchants came to Constantinople and sold their merchandise, that image which is on the wall spoke to them, by grace of a marvel which Allah granted to me; so they made for that hermitage and slew Matruhina, after torturing him with most grievous torments, and dragging him by the beard, till he showed them the place where I was; when they took me and found no path but flight for dread of death. Now tomorrow night Tamasil will visit that hermitage as is her habit, and her father and his squires will come after her, as he feareth for her; so, if ye would witness these things, take me with you and I will deliver to you the monies and the riches of the Knight Dakianus which be in that mountain; for I saw them bring out vessels of gold and silver to drink therefrom, and I heard a damsel of their company sing to them in Arabic and well-away! that so sweet a voice should not be busied in chaunting the Koran. If, then, ye will; enter into that hermitage and hide there against the coming of Dakianus and his daughter; and take her, for she is fit only for the King of the Age, Sharrkan, or King Zau al-Makan."" Thereat they all rejoiced with the exception of the Wazir Dandan, who put scant faith in her story, for her words took no hold on his reason, and signs of doubt in her and disbelief showed in his face.[FN#429] Yet he was confounded at her discourse, but he feared to speak with her for awe of the King. Then quoth the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, ""Verily, I fear lest the Knight come and, seeing these troops encamped in the meadow, be afraid to enter the hermitage."" So Zau al-Makan ordered the army to march upon Constantinople and said, ""I have resolved to take with me an hundred horse and many mules and make for that mountain, where we will load the beasts with the monies which be in the hermitage."" Then he sent at once for the Chief Chamberlain whom they brought into the presence; and he summoned likewise the leaders of the Turks and Daylamites and said, ""As soon as it is dawn, do ye set forth for Constantinople; and thou, O Chamberlain, shalt take my place in council and contrivance, while thou, O Rustam, shalt be my brother's deputy in battle. But let none know that we are not with you and after three days we will rejoin you."" Then he chose out an hundred of the doughtiest riders, and he and Sharrkan and the Minister Dandan set out for the hermitage, and the hundred horsemen led the mules with chests for transporting the treasure.‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Ninety-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan and his brother, Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan set off with an hundred horse for the hermitage described to them by that accursed Zat al-Dawahi, and they took with them mules and chests for transporting the treasure. Now as soon as dawned the morn, the Chamberlain signalled to the host an order for departure, and they set out thinking that the two Kings and the Wazir were with them; knowing not that the three had made for the monastery. Such was the case with the host, but as regards the two Kings and the Minister, they tarried in their place till the end of that day. Now the Infidels who were with Zat al-Dawahi took their departure privily, after they had gone in to her and kissed her hands and feet and obtained her leave to march. So she not only gave them permission but also taught them all she minded of wile and guile. And when it was dark night, she arose and went in to Zau al-Makan and his companions and said to them, ""Come, let us set out for the mountain, and take with you a few men at arms."" They obeyed her and left five horsemen at the foot of the mountain, whilst the rest rode on before Zat al-Dawahi, who gained new strength for excess of joy, so that Zau al-Makan said, ""Glory be to Him who sustaineth this holy man, whose like we never saw!"" Now the witch had written a letter to the King of Constantinople and despatched it on the wings of a bird,[FN#430] acquainting him with what had passed and ending, ""I wish thee to send me ten thousand horsemen of the bravest of the Greeks and let them steal along the foot of the mountains with caution, lest the host of Al-Islam get sight of them; and, when they reach the hermitage, let them ambush themselves there, till I come to them with the Moslem King and his brother, for I shall inveigle them and will bring them thither, together with the Wazir and an hundred horse and no more, that I may presently deliver to them the crosses which be in the hermitage. I am resolved to slay the Monk Matruhina, since my scheme cannot be carried out but by taking his life. If my plot work well, not one of the Moslems shall return to his own country; no, not a living wight nor one who blows the fire alight; and Matruhina shall be a sacrifice for the followers of the Nazarene faith and the servants of the Cross, and praise be to the Messiah, first and last."" When this letter reached Constantinople, the keeper of the carrier pigeons carried it to King Afridun, who read it and forthwith inspected his host and equipped ten thousand cavaliers with horses and dromedaries and mules and provaunt and bade them repair to that hermitage and, after reaching the tower, to hide therein. Thus far concerning them; but as regards King Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan and the escort, when they reached the hermitage they entered and met the Monk Matruhina, who came out to see who and what they were; whereupon quoth that pious man Zat al-Dawahi, ""Slay this damned fellow.""[FN#431] So they smote him with their swords and made him drink the cup of death. Then the accursed old woman carried them to the place of offerings and ex votos, and brought out to them treasures and precious things more than she had described to them; and after gathering the whole together, they set the booty in chests and loaded the mules therewith. As for Tamasil, she came not, she or her father, for fear of the Moslems; so Zau al-Makan tarried there, awaiting her all that day and the next and a third, till Sharrkan said to him, ""By Allah, I am troubled anent the army of Al-Islam, for I know not what is become of them."" His brother replied, ""And I also am concerned for them: we have come by this great treasure and I do not believe that Tamasil or any one else will approach the hermitage, after that befel which hath befallen the host of the Christians. It behoveth us, then, to content ourselves with what Allah hath given us and depart; so haply He will help us conquer Constantinople."" Accordingly they came down from the mountain, while Zat al-Dawahi was impotent to oppose their march for fear of betraying her deceit; and they fared forwards till they reached the head of a defile, where the old woman had laid an ambush for them with the ten thousand horse. As soon as these saw the Moslems they encircled them from all sides, couching lance and baring the white sabre blade; and the Infidels shouted the watch word of their faithless Faith and set the shafts of their mischief astring. When Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Minister Dandan looked upon this host, they saw that it was a numerous army and said, ""Who can have given these troops information of us?"" Replied Sharrkan, ""O my brother, this be no time for talk; this is the time for smiting with swords and shooting with shafts) so gird up your courage and hearten your hearts, for this strait is like a street with two gates; though, by the virtue of the Lord of Arabs and Ajams, were not the place so narrow I would bring them to naught, even though they were an hundred thousand men!"" Said Zau al-Makan, ""Had we wotted this we would have brought with us five thousand horse;"" and the Wazir Dandan continued, ""If we had ten thousand horse they had availed us naught in these narrows; but Allah will succour us against them. I know this defile and its straitness, and I know there be many places of refuge in it; for I have been here on razzia with King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, what while we besieged Constantinople. We abode in this place, and here is water colder than snow. So come, let us push out of this defile ere the Infidel host increase on us and get the start of us to the mountain top, whence they will hurl down rocks upon us, and we powerless to come at them."" So they began hurrying on to get out of those narrows; but the pious man, Zat al-Dawahi, looked at them and said, ""What is it ye fear, ye who have vowed yourselves to the Lord, and to working His will? By Allah, I abode imprisoned underground for fifteen years, yet never gainsaid the Almighty in aught he did with me! Fight ye in Allah's way; so whoever of you is slain Paradise shall be his abode, and whoso slayeth, his striving shall be to his honour."" When they heard from the ascetic these words, their care and anxiety ceased from them and they stood firm till the Infidels charged down from all sides, whilst the swords played upon their necks and the cup of death went round amongst them. The Moslems fought for the service of Allah a right good fight, and wrought upon His foes with sway of sword and lunge of lance; whilst Zau al-Makan smote upon the men and garred the knights bite the dust and their heads from their bodies take flight, five by five and ten by ten, till he had done to death a number of them past numbering and an accompt beyond counting. Now while so doing, he looked at the accursed old woman who was waving her sword and heartening them, and all who feared fled to her for shelter; but she was also signing the Infidels to slay Sharrkan. So troop after troop rushed on him with design to do him die; but each troop that charged, he charged and drove back; and when another troop attacked him he repelled the assault with the sword in their backs; for he thought it was the devotee's blessing that gave him the vic tory, and he said in himself, ""Verily on this holy men Allah looketh with eyes of His favour and strengtheneth my prowess against the Infidels with the purity of his pious intent: for I see that they fear me and cannot prevail against me, but every one who assaileth me turneth tail and taketh flight."" So they battled the rest of the day and, when night fell, the Moslems took refuge in a cave of that defile being weary with stress of war and cast of stone: and that day were slain of them five and forty. And when they were gathered together, they sought the devotee, but could find no trace of him; and this was grievous to them and they said, ""Belike, he hath died a martyr."" Quoth Sharrkan, ""I saw him heartening the horsemen with divine instances and using as talisman verses of Holy Writ."" Now while they were talking, behold, the accursed old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, stood before them, hending in hand the head of the Chief Captain of the ten thousand horse, a noble knight, a champion fierce in fight and a Satan for blight. One of the Turks had slain him with an arrow, and Allah hurried his soul to the fire; and when the Infidels saw what that Moslem had done with their leader, they all fell on him and wrought his bane and hewed him in pieces with their swords, and Allah hurried his soul to Heaven. Then the accursed old woman cut off that Knight's head and brought it and threw it at the feet of Sharrkan and Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan. Now when Sharrkan sew her, he sprang up hastily before her and exclaimed, ""Praised be Allah for thy safety and for our sighting thee, O holy man and devout champion of the Religion!"" Replied she, O my son, I have sought martyrdom this day, and have thrown my life away amid the Infidel array, but they feared me with dismay. When ye dispersed, I waxed jealous for your honour; so I rushed on the Chief Knight their leader, albeit he was a match for a thousand horse, and I smote him till I severed head from trunk. Not one of the Infidels could near me; so I brought his head to you,""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Ninety-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damned witch, Zat al-Dawahi, took the head of the Knight, the leader of the twenty thousand Infidels, she brought it and threw it down before Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan, saying, ""When I saw your condition, I waxed jealous for your honour; so I rushed on the Chief Knight and smote him with the sword till I severed head from trunk. And none could near me, so I brought his head to you, that you may be strengthened in Holy War and work out with your swords the will of the Lord of the Faithful. And now I purpose leaving you to strive against the Infidels, whilst I go to your army, though they be at the gates of Constantinople, and return with twenty thousand horse to destroy these Unfaithfuls."" Quoth Sharrkan, ""How wilt thou pass to them, O thou holy man, seeing that the valley is blocked up on all sides by the Miscreants?"" Quoth the accursed hag, ""Allah will veil me from their eyes and they shall not sight me;[FN#432] nor, if any saw me, would he dare to attack me at that time, for I shall be as one non existing, absorbed in Allah, and He will fend off from me His foes."" ""Thou sayest sooth, O holy man,"" rejoined Sharrkan, ""for indeed I have been witness of that; so, if thou can pass out at the first of the night, 'twill be best for us."" Replied she, ""I will set out at this very hour and, if thou desire, thou shalt go with me and none shall see thee. Furthermore if thy brother also have a mind to go with us we will take him, but none else; for the shadow of a saint can cover only twain."" Sharrkan said, ""As for me I will not leave my comrades; but, if my brother will, there is no harm in his going with thee and setting us free of this strait; for he is the stronghold of the Moslems and the sword of the Lord of the three Worlds; and if it be his pleasure, let him take with him the Wazir Dandan, or whom else he may elect and send us ten thousand horse to succour us against these caitiffs."" So after debate they agreed on this and the old woman said, ""Give me leisure to go before you and consider the condition of the Infidels, if they be asleep or awake."" Quoth they, ""We will not go forth save with thee and trust our affair to Allah."" ""If I do your bidding,"" replied she, ""blame me not but blame yourselves; for it is my rede that you await me till I bring you tidings of the case."" Then said Sharrkan, ""Go to them and delay not from us, for we shall be awaiting thee."" Thereupon she fared forth and Sharrkan turned to his brother addressing him and said, ""Were not this holy man a miracle worker, he had never slain yonder furious knight. This is proof sufficient of the ascetic's power; and of a truth the pride of the Infidels is laid low by the slaying of this cavalier, for he was violent, an evil devil and a stubborn."" Now whilst they were thus devising of the mighty works of the devotee, behold, the accursed Zat al-Dawahi came upon them and promised them victory over the Unbelievers; wherefor they thanked her (not knowing that all this was wile and guile) and the damned hag asked, ""Where be the King of the Age, Zau al-Makan, and the Minister Dandan?"" Answered he, ""Here am I!"" Take with thee thy Wazir,"" said she, ""and follow after me, that we may fare forth to Constantinople."" Now she had acquainted the Infidels with the cheat she had put upon the Moslems, and they rejoiced with exceeding great joy, and said, Our hearts will not be contented till we shall have slain their King in return for the Knight's death; because we had no stouter rider than he;"" and they added (bespeaking the ill omened hag as she told them her plan of faring to the land of the Moslems), ""When thou bringest him to us, we will bear him to King Afridun."" Then she went out and went out with her Zau al-Makan and the Minister Dandan, and she walked on before the two saying, ""Fare forth with the blessing of Almighty Allah!"" So they did her bidding, for the shaft of Pate and Fortune of man's lot had shot them, and she ceased not leading them both through the midst of the Grecian camp, till they came to the defile, the narrow pass aforesaid, whilst the Infidel enemy watched them, but did them no hindrance; for the infernal old woman had enjoined this. Now when Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan saw that the Infidel host offered them no let and stay and yet had them in sight, the Wazir exclaimed, ""By Allah, this is one of the holy man's saintly miracles! and doubtless he be of the elect."" Rejoined Zau al-Makan, ""By Allah, I think the Infidels be naught but blind, for we see them and they see us not."" And while they were thus praising the holy man and recounting his mighty works and his piety and his prayers, behold, the Infidels charged down on them from all sides and surrounded them and seized them, saying, ""Is there anyone else with you twain, that we may seize upon him too?"" And the Wazir Dandan replied, ""See you not yon other man that is before us? ' Replied the Unbelievers, ""By the truth of the Messiah and the Monks, and the Primate and the Metropolitan, we see none save you two!"" Then Zau Al-Makan said, ""By Allah, this is a chastisement decreed to us by Almighty Allah!""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Ninety-eighth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Unfaithful had seized upon King Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan, they said to the two, ""Is there anyone else with you twain, that we may seize upon him also?"" And the Wazir Dandan replied, ""See you not yon other man who be with us?"" They rejoined, ""By the truth of the Messiah and the Monks and the Primate and the Metropolitan, we see none save you two!"" Then the Infidels laid shackles on their feet and set men to guard them during the night, whilst Zat al-Dawahi fared on and disappeared from their sight. So they fell to lamenting and saying to each other, ""Verily, the opposing of pious men leadeth to greater distress than this, and we are punished by the strait which hath befallen us."" So far concerning Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan; but as regards King Sharrkan, he passed that night in the cavern with his comrades, and when dawned the day and he had prayed the morn prayer, he and his men made ready to do battle with the Infidel and he heartened them and promised them all good. Then they sallied out till they were hard upon the Unbelievers and, when these saw them from afar, they cried out to them, saying, ""O Moslems, we have taken captives your Sultan and your Wazir who hath the ordering of your affairs; and except ye leave off fighting us, we will slay you to the last man; but an you yield yourselves we will take you to our King, who will make peace with you on condition that you quit our country and return home and harm us in naught, and we will do you no harm in aught. If ye accept, it will be well for you; but if ye refuse there remaineth nothing for you but death. So we have told you sooth, and this is our last word to you."" Now when Sharrkan heard this and was certified of the captivity of his brother and the Wazir Dandan, he was weighed down with woe and wept; his force failed him and, making sure of death, he said to himself, ""Would I knew the cause of their capture! Did they fail of respect to the holy man or disobey him, or what was the matter?"" Then they sprang up to battle with the Unbelievers and slew great numbers of them. The brave was known that day from craven men, and sword and spear were dyed with bloody stain; for the Infidels flocked up on them, as flies flock to drink, from hill and from plain; but Sharrkan and his men ceased not to wage the fight of those who fear not to die, nor let death hinder them from the pursuit of victory, till the valley ran gore and earth was full of the slain she bore. And when night fell the armies separated each making for his own place; and the Moslems returned to the cavern where gain and loss were manifest to them: few remained of them and there was no dependence for them but on Allah and the scymitar. Now there had been slain of them that day five and thirty men of the chiefest Emirs, and they had killed thousands of the Infidels, footmen and fighters on horse. When Sharrkan saw this, the case was grievous to him and he asked his comrades ""What shall we do?""; whereto all answered, ""That which Almighty Allah willeth shall befal us."" On the morning of the second day, Sharrkan said to the remnant of his troop, ""If ye go forth to fight, not one of you will remain alive and we have but little left of food and water; so I deem ye would do better to bare your brands and go forth and stand at the mouth of this cavern, to hinder any from entering. Haply the holy man may have reached the Moslem host, and may return with ten thousand horses to succour us in fight with the Infidels, for belike the Unfaithful may have failed to see him and those with him."" They said, This were the better course to take, and of its expediency no doubt we make."" So the troop went out and held the cavern mouth standing by its walls; and every one of the Infidels who sought to enter in, they slew. Thus did they fend off the foe from the gape of the cave and they patiently supported all such assaults, till day was done and night came on dusky and dun;‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Ninety-ninth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the army of the Moslems held the cavern mouth and stood by its walls and they fended off the foe, and every one of the Infidels attempted to charge them, him they slew; and they patiently supported all such assaults till day was done and night came on dusky and dun, by which time King Sharrkan had only five and twenty men and no more left. Then quoth the Infidels to one another, ""When shall these battle days have an end? We are weary of warring the Moslems."" And quoth one of them, ""Up and at them, for there remain of them but five and twenty men! If we cannot prevail on them to fight, let us light a fire upon them;[FN#433] and if they submit themselves and yield to us, we will take them prisoners; but if they refuse we will leave them for fuel to the fire, so shall they become to men of foreseeing mind a warning dire. May the Messiah on their fathers have no grace, and may the sojourn of the Nazarenes be for them no abiding place!"" So they carried fuel to the jaws of the cavern and set fire to it. Thereupon Sharrkan and his companions made sure of perdition and yielded themselves prisoners. And while they were in this condition, lo! the knight their captain said to those who counselled their slaughter, ""It is not for any save for King Afridun to kill them, that he may gratify his wrath; therefore it behoveth us to keep them in durance by us till the morrow, when we will journey with them to Constantinople and deliver them to our King, who shall deal with them as he please."" Said they, ""This is the right course;"" and he commanded to pinion them and set guards over them. Then, as soon as it was black night, the Infidels busied themselves with feasting and making festival; and they called for wine and drank it till all fell upon their backs. Now Sharrkan and his brother, Zau al-Makan, were in confinement and so also were his companion knights; whereupon the elder turned to the younger brother and said to him, ""O my brother, how win free?"" ""By Allah,"" replied Zau al Makan, ""I know not; for here we be like birds in cage."" Then Sharrkan waxed wroth and sighed for excess of rage and stretched himself, till his pinion bonds brass asunder; whereupon being free he arose and went up to the Captain of the guard, and taking from his pocket the keys of the fetters, freed Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the rest of his men. Then he turned to the two and said, ""I desire to slay three of these Infidels and take and don their dress, we three; so that we shall be guised as Greeks and we will pass through them, with out their knowing us, and fare forth to our own force."" Replied Zau al-Makan, ""This is no safe counsel for if we kill them, I fear some of their comrades may hear their shrieks and the foe be aroused upon us and kill us. 'Twere the surer way to pass out of the defile."" So they agreed upon this and set out; and, when they had left the head of the strait a little distance behind, they saw horses picketed and the riders sleeping: and Sharrkan said to his brother, ""Better we take each one of us a steed."" There were five and twenty horsemen, so they took five and twenty horses, whilst Allah sent sleep upon the Infidels for a purpose He knew and the Faithful mounted and fared on till they were out of reach. Meanwhile Sharrkan set to gathering from the Infidels as many weapons, swords, and spears, as were wanted. And while they took saddle and struck forwards none of the Infidels supposed that anyone could release Zau al-Makan and his brother and their men; or that their prisoners had power to escape. Now when all the captives were safe from the Unfaithful, Sharrkan came up with his comrades, and found them awaiting his arrival, on coals of flame, expecting him in anxious grame, so he turned to them and said, ""Feel no fear since Allah protecteth us. I have that to propose which haply shall effect our purpose."" ""What is it?"" asked they and he answered, ""I desire that ye all climb to the mountain top and cry out with one voice, 'Allaho Akbar!' and ye add, 'The army of Al Islam is upon you! Allaho Akbar!' This wise their company will surely be dissolved nor will they find out the trick for they are drunk, but they will think that the Moslem troops have encompassed them about on all sides and have mingled with them; so they will fall on one another brand in hand during the confusion of drunkenness and sleep, and we will cleave them asunder with their own swords and the scymitar will go round amongst them till dawn."" Replied Zau al-Makan, ""This plan is not good; we should do better to make our way to our army and speak not a word; for if we cry out 'Allaho Akbar,' they will wake and fall on us and not one of us will escape."" Rejoined Sharrkan, ""By Allah, though they should awake tis no matter, and I long that ye fall in with my plan, for naught save good can come of it!"" So they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain and shouted, ""Allaho Akbar!"" And hills and trees and rocks reworded their Allaho Akbar for fear of the Almighty. But when the Kafirs heard this slogan they cried out to one another,‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundredth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan spake thus, ""I long that ye fall in with this my plan, for naught save good can come of it."" So they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain head and shouted, ""Allaho Akbar!""; and hills and trees and rocks re worded their Allaho Akbar for fear of the Almighty. The Infidels heard it and cried out one to other and donned their armour and said, ""The foe is upon us, by the truth of the Messiah!"" Then they fell on one another and slew of their own men more than any knoweth save Almighty Allah. As soon as it was dawn, they sought for the captives, but found no trace of them, and their captains said, ""They who did this were the prisoners in our possession; up, then, and after them in all haste till ye overtake them, when we will make them quaff the cup of requital; and let not fright nor the panic of sudden awaking possess you."" So they took horse and rode after the fugitives and it wanted but an eye twinkling before they overtook them and surrounded them. Now when Zau al-Makan saw this, he was seized with increase of terror and said to his brother, ""What I feared would come, is come upon us, and now it remaineth only for us to fight for the Faith."" But Sharrkan preferred to hold his peace. Then Zau al- Makan and his companions rushed down from the hill crest, shouting, ""Allaho Akbar!"" and his men repeated the war cry and addressed themselves to fight and to sell their lives in the service of the Lord of Faithful Men; and while they were in this case, behold, they heard many voices voicing, ""There is no god but the God! God is most great! Salutation and salvation upon the Apostle, the Bringer of glad Tidings, the Bearer of bad Tidings!''[FN#434] So they turned towards the direction of the sound and saw a company of Moslems who believed in one God, pushing towards them, whereat their hearts were heartened and Sharrkan charged upon the Infidels crying out, ""There is no god but the God! God is most great! he and those with him, so that earth quaked as with an earthquake and the Unbeliever host brake asunder and fled into the mountains and the Moslems followed them with lunge and blow; and Zau al-Makan and his comrades of the Moslems ceased not to smite the hosts of the Infidel foe, and parted heads from bodies till day darkened and night coming on starkened sight. Thereupon the Moslems drew together and passed the night in congratulations, and, when morning dawned and daybreak shone with its shine and sheen, they saw Bahram, the captain of the Daylamites, and Rustam, the captain of the Turks, advancing to join them, with twenty thousand cavaliers like lions grim. As soon as they saw Zau al-Makan, the riders dismounted and saluted him, and kissed ground between his hands when he said to them, ""Rejoice ye in the glad tidings of the victory of the Moslem and the discomfiture of the tribe of Unbelievers!"" Then they gave one another joy of their deliverance and of the greatness of their reward after Resurrection Day. Now the cause of the coming of the succours to that place was this. When the Emir Bahram and the Emir Rustam and the Chief Chamberlain, with the Moslem host and flags flaunting high ahead, came in sight of Constantinople they saw that the Nazarenes had mounted the walls and manned the towers and the forts, and had set all their defenders in order of defence, as soon as they learned of the approach of the host of Al-Islam and the banners Mohammedan, and they heard the clash of arms and the noise of war voices and tramp of horse hoofs and from their look outs they beheld the Moslems, with their standards and ensigns of the Faith of Unity under the dust clouds and lo! they were like a flight of locusts or rain clouds raining rain, and the voices of the Moslems chanting the Koran and glorifying the Compassionate One, struck their ears. Now the Infidels knew of the approach of this host through Zat al-Dawahi with her craft and whoredom,[FN#435] calumny and contrivance. And the armies of Al-Islam drew near, as it were the swollen sea, for the multitude of footmen and horsemen and women and children. Then quoth the General of the Turks to the General of the Daylamites, ""O Emir, of a truth, we are in jeopardy from the multitude of the foe who is on the walls. Look at yonder bulwarks and at this world of folk like the seas that clash with dashing billows. Indeed yon Infidel outnumbereth us an hundredfold and we cannot be safe from spies who may inform them that we are without a Sultan. In very sooth, we run danger from these enemies, whose numbers may not be told and whose resources none can withhold, especially in the absence of King Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the illustrious Wazir Dandan. If they know of this, they will be emboldened to attack us in their absence and with the sword they will annihilate us to the last man; not one of us safety shall see. So it is my counsel that thou take ten thousand riders of the allies and the Turks, and march them to the hermitage of Matruhina and the meadow of Mal√∫khin√° in quest of our brothers and comrades. If thou act by my advice, it may be we shall approve ourselves the cause of their deliverance, in case they be hard pressed by the Infidels; and if thou act not, blame will not attach to me. But, an ye go, it behoveth that ye return quickly, for ill suspicion is part of prudence."" The Emir aforesaid fell in with his counsel; so they chose twenty thousand horse and they set out covering the roads and making for the monastery above mentioned. So much for the cause of their coming; but as regards the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, as soon as she had delivered Sultan Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan into the hands of the Infidels, the foul whore mounted a swift steed, saying to the Faithless, ""I design to rejoin the Moslem army which is at Constantinople and contrive for their destruction; for I will inform them that their chiefs are dead, and when they hear that from me, their joining will be disjointed and the cord of their confederation cut and their host scattered. Then will I go to King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, and to my son Hardub, King of Roum, and relate to them their tidings and they will sally forth on the Moslems with their troops and will destroy them and will not leave one of them alive."" So she mounted and struck across country on her good steed all the livelong night; and, when day dawned, appeared the armies of Bahram and Rustam advancing towards her. So she turned into a wayside brake and hid her horse among the trees and she walked a while saying to herself, ""Haply the Moslem hosts be returning, routed, from the assault of Constantinople."" However, as she drew near them she looked narrowly and made sure that their standards were not reversed,[FN#436] and she knew that they were coming not as conquered men, but fearing for their King and comrades. When she was assured of this, she hastened towards them, running at speed, like a devil of ill rede, till reaching them she cried out, ""Haste ye! haste ye! O soldiers of the Compassionate One, hasten to the Holy War against the hosts of Satan!"" When Bahram saw her he dismounted and kissed the ground before her and asked her, ""O friend of Allah what is behind thee?"" Answered she, ""Question not of sad case and sore condition; for when our comrades had taken the treasure from the hermitage of Matruhina, and designed to win their way Constantinople wards, thereupon came out on them a driving host and a dreadful of the Infidels."" And the damned witch repeated to them the story to fill them with trouble and terror, adding, ""The most of them are dead, and there are but five and twenty men left."" Said Bahram, ""O holy man! when didst thou leave them?"" ""But this night,""[FN#437] replied she. He cried, ""Glory be to Allah! to Him who hath rolled up the far distance for thee like a rug, so that thou hast sped thus walking upon thy feet and props upon a mid-rib of palm-tree! But thou art one of the saints which fly like birds when inspired and possessed by His directions.""[FN#438] Then he mounted his horse, and he was perplexed and confounded by what he had heard from the beldam so strong in lies and ill calumnies, and he said, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verily our labour is lost and our hearts are heavy within us, for our Sultan is a prisoner and those who are with him."" Then they cut across the country, wide and side, night and day, and when morning dawned they reached the head of the defile and saw Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan shouting. ""There is no god but the God! Allaho Akbar! and Salutation and Salvation upon the Congratulator, the Comminator.""[FN#439] Whereupon he and his drove at the Unbelievers and whelmed them, as the rain torrent whelms the waste; and cried out their war cries, till fear get hold of the prowess Knights and the mountains were cloven in affright. And when shone the day and showed its shine and sheen, the breeze of morning blew upon them sweet and fragrant, and each recognised other as hath been said before. Then they kissed the ground before the King and before his brother Sharrkan, who told them all that had befallen the party in the cave. Now thereat they marvelled and said to one another, ""Hasten we back to Constantinople, for we left our companions there, and our hearts are with them."" So they hurried departure, commending themselves to the Subtle, the All-wise, and Zau al-Makan exhorted the Moslems to steadfast- ness and versified in the following couplets,[FN#440]

""Be praises mine to all praiseworthy Thee, * O Lord, who stinted
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    not mine aid to be!
Though was I lost abroad, Thou west to me * Strongest support
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    which vouchsafed victory:
Thou gav'st me wealth and reign and goodly gifts, * And slungest
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    con quering sword of valiancy:
Thou mad'st me blest beneath Thy kingly shade, * Engraced with
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    generous boons dealt fain and free:
Thou savedst *from every fear I feared, by aid * Of my Wazir, the
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    Age's noblest he!
Garred us Thy grace in fight to throw the Greek, * Who yet came
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     back dight in War's cramoisie:
Then made I feint to fly from out the fight; * But like grim lion
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   turning made them flee,
And left on valley sole my foemen, drunk * Not with old
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   wine[FN#441] but Death-cup's revelry:
Then came the Saintly Hermit, and he showed * His marvels wrought
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    for town and wold to see;
When slew they hero-wights who woke to dwell * In Eden bowers
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   wherein sweet rill-lets well.""

But, when Zau al-Makan had made an end of versifying, his brother Sharrkan congratulated him on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done; after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their army.‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and First Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan congratulated his brother, Zau al-Makan, on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done; after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their army. Such was their case; but as regards the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, after she had foregathered with the hosts of Rustam and Bahram, she returned to the coppice, where she took her steed and mounted and sped on at speed, till she drew near the Moslem army that beleaguered Constantinople, when she lighted down from her destrier and led it to the pavilion tent of the Chief Chamberlain. And when he saw her, he stood up to her in honour and signed to her with his right hand and said, ""Welcome O pious recluse!"" Then he questioned her of what had befallen, and she repeated to him her disquieting lies and deluding calumnies, saying, ""In sooth I fear for the Emir Rustam, and the Emir Bahram, for that I met them and theirs on the way and sent them and their following to relieve the King and his companions. Now there are but twenty thousand horse and the Unbelievers outnumber them; so I would have thee at this moment send off the rest of thy troops at full speed to their suc cour, lest they be slain to the last man."" And she cried to them, ""Haste! Haste!"" When the Chamberlain and the Moslems heard these words, their spirits fell and they wept; but Zat al-Dawahi said to them, ""Ask aidance of Allah and bear patiently this triburation; for ye have the example of those who have been before you of the people of Mohammed; and Paradise with its palaces is laid out by Allah for those who die martyrs; and needs must all die, but most praiseworthy is dying while fighting for the Faith."" The Chamberlain, hearing this speech of the accursed old woman, called for the Emir Bahram's brother, a knight by name Tarkash; and, choosing out for him ten thousand horse, riders famed for force, bade him set out at once. So he fared forth and marched all that day and the whole of the next night, till he neared the Moslems. When daylight dawned, Sharrkan saw the dust cloud about them and feared for the men of Al-Islam and said, ""If these troops which are coming upon us be Moslem men our victory is assured by them; but, if these be Nazarenes, there is no gainsaying Destiny's decrees."" Then he turned to his brother, Zau al- Makan, and said, Never fear, for with my life I will ransom thee from death. If these be Mohammedan troops, then were it an increase of heavenly favours; but, if they be our foes, there is no help save that we fight them. Yet do I long to meet the Holy Man ere I die, so I may beg him to pray that I die not save by death of martyrdom."" Whilst the twain were thus speaking, behold, there appeared the banners inscribed with the words, ""There is no god but the God and Mohammed is the Apostle of God;"" and Sharrkan cried out, ""How is it with the Moslems?"" ""All are sound and safe,"" replied they, ""and we came not but out of concern for you."" Then the Chief of the army dismounted and, kissing ground before Sharrkan, asked, ""O my lord, how be the Sultan and the Wazir Dandan and Rustam and my brother Bahram; are they all in safety?"" He answered, ""All well; but who brought thee tidings of us?"" Quoth Tarkash; ""It was the Holy Man who told us that he had met my brother Bahram and Rustam and had sent them both to you and he also assured us that the Infidels had encompassed you and out numbered you; but I see not the case save the contrary thereof and that you are victorious."" They questioned him, ""And how did the Holy Man reach you?""; and he replied, ""Walking on his feet and he had compassed in a day and a night, ten days' journey for a well girt horseman."" ""There is no doubt but that he is a Saint of Allah,"" said Sharrkan, ""but where is he now?"" They rejoined, ""We left him with our troops, the folk of the Faith, moving them to do battle with the rebels and the Faithless."" Thereat Sharrkan rejoiced and all thanked Allah for their own deliverance and the safety of the Holy Man; and commended the dead to His mercy saying, ""This was writ in the Book."" Then they set out making for Constantinople by forced marches, and whilst they were on this enterprise, behold, a dust cloud arose to such height that it walled the two horizons, the eastern and the western, from man's sight and the day was darkened by it to night. But Sharrkan looked at it and said, ""Verily, I fear lest this be the Infidels who have routed the army of Al-Islam for that this dust walleth the world, east and west, and hideth the two horizons, north and south."" Presently appeared under the dust a pillar of darkness, blacker than the blackness of dismal days; nor ceased to come upon them that column more dreadful than the dread of the Day of Doom. Horse and foot hastened up to look at it and know the terrors of the case, when behold, they saw it to be the recluse aforesaid; so they thronged round him to kiss his hands and he cried out, ""O people of the Best of Mankind,[FN#442] the lamp which shineth in darkness blind, verily the Infidels have outwitted the Moslems by guile, for they fell upon the host of the One God whilst they deemed themselves safe from the Faithless, and attacked them in their tents and made a sore slaughter of them what while they looked for no wile; so hasten to the aid of the Believers in the unity of God, and deliver them from those who deny Him!"" Now when Sharrkan heard these words, his heart flew from his breast with sore trouble; and, alighting from his steed in amazement, he kissed the Recluse's hands and feet. On like wise did his brother, Zau al-Makan, and the rest of the foot and horse troops; except the Wazir Dandan, who dismounted not but said, ""By Allah, my heart flieth from this devotee, for I never knew show of devotion to religion that bred not bane. So leave him and rejoin your comrades the Moslems, for this man is of the outcasts from the gate of the mercy of the Lord of the Three Worlds! How often have I here made razzias with King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and trodden the earth of these lands!"" Said Sharrkan, ""Put away from thee such evil thought, hast thou not seen this Holy Man exciting the Faithful to fight, and holding spears and swords light? So slander him not, for backbiting is blameable and poisoned is the flesh of the pious.[FN#443] Look how he inciteth us to fight the foe; and, did not Almighty Allah love him, He had cast him aforetime into fearful torment."" Then Sharrkan bade bring a Nubian mule for the ascetic to ride and said, ""Mount, O pious man, devout and virtuous!"" But the devotee refused to ride and feigned self denial, that he might attain his end; and they knew not that this holy personage was like him of whom the poet saith,

""He prayeth and he fasteth for an end he doth espy; * When once his end is safely won then fast and prayer good bye.""[FN#444]

So the devotee ceased not to walk among the horsemen and the footmen, like a wily fox meditating guile, and began to uplift her voice, chanting the Koran and praising the Compassionate One. And they continued pressing forward till they approached the camp of Al-Islam, where Sharrkan found the Moslem in conquered plight and the Chamberlain upon the brink of falling back in flight, whilst the sword of Greece havoc dight among the Faithful, the righteous and those who work upright,‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan saw the Moslems in conquered plight and the Chamberlain upon the brink of retreat and flight and the sword havoc dight among the righteous and the workers of upright, the cause of this weakness among the Moslems was that the accursed old woman, Zat al- Dawahi, the foe of the Faith, after seeing that Bahram and Rustam had set forward with their troops to join Sharrkan and his brother Zau al-Makan, repaired to the camp of the Mahometans before Constantinople and caused the mission of the Emir Tarkash, as hath been before said. In this her purpose was to divide the Moslem forces the better to weaken them. Then she left them and entered Constantinople, and called with a loud voice on the knights of the Greeks, saying, ""Let me down a cord that I may tie thereto this letter, and do ye bear it to your King Afridun, that he may read it and to my son King Hardub that they both do what is written therein of bidding and forbidding."" So they let down for her a string and she tied thereto a letter whose purport was the following: ""From the terriblest of tribulations[FN#445] and the chiefest of all calamities, Zat al-Dawahi, to King Afridun greeting. But afterwards, of a truth I have contrived a device for destroying the Moslems; so bide ye quiet and content. I have cozened and captured their Sultan and the Wazir Dandan; and then I returned to their camp and acquainted them therewith, whereby their pride had a fall and their withers were wrung. And I have so wrought upon the host 'leaguering Constantinople that they have sent ten thousand men under the Emir Tarkash to succour the capitves, of whom there be now left but few; it is therefore my object that ye sally forth against them with all your power while this day endureth; and that ye fall on them in their tents and that ye leave them not till ye shall have slain them to the last man; for, verily the Messiah looketh down upon you and the Blessed Virgin favoureth you; and I hope of the Messiah that he forget not what deed I have done."" When her letter came to King Afridun, he rejoiced with great joyance; and, sending at once for King Hardub of Greece, son of Zat al-Dawahi, read the letter to him as soon as he came,whereathe was exceeding glad and said, ""See my mother's craft; verily it dispenseth with swords, and her aspect standeth in stead of the terrors of the Day of Dread."" Rejoined Afridun, ""May the Messiah not bereave us of thy venerable parent nor deprive her of her wile and guile!"" Then he bade the Knights give orders for sallying outside the city, and the news was noised abroad in Constantinople. So the Nazarenes and the cohorts of the Cross burst forth and unsheathed their keen sabres in their numbers, shouting out their professions of impiety and heresies, and blaspheming the Lord of all Creatures. When the Chamberlain saw the sally, he said, ""Behold, the Greek is upon us and they surely have learned that our Sultan is far away; and haply they have attacked us, for that the most part of our troops have marched to the succour of King Zau al-Makan!"" Therewith he waxed wroth and cried out, ""Ho, soldiers of Al-Islam and favourers of the True Faith, an you flee you are lost, but if ye stand fast, ye win! Know ye that valiancy lieth in endurance of outrance and that no case is so strait but that the Almighty is able to make it straight; Allah assain you and look upon you with eyes of compassion fain!"" Thereupon the Moslems cried out, ""Allaho Akbar!"" and the believer in the One God shouted his slogan, and whirled the mill wheels of fight with cutting and thrusting in main and might; scymitars and spears played sore and the plains and valleys were swamped with gore. The priests and monks priested it, tight girding their girdles and uplifting the Crucifixes, while the Moslem shouted out the professions of the Requiting King and verses of the Koran began to sing. The hosts of the Compassion are One fought against the legions of Satan; and head flew from body of man, while the good Angels hovered above the people of the Chosen Prophet, nor did the sword cease to smite till the day darkened and night came on and starkened. Now the miscreants had encompassed the Moslems and made sure of escaping the pains that awaited them; and the Faithless greeded for victory over the Faithful until day dawned and dazzled. There upon the Chamberlain mounted, he and his men, trusting thee Allah would help them to victory; and host was mingled with host and battle rose a foot and took post. And heads flew from trunks whilst the brave stood fast in stead; the craven turned tail and fled; and the Judge of death judged and sentence sped, so that the champions fell from their saddles slain and corpses cumbered meadow and plain. Then the Moslem began to give ground and rearwards bent; and the Greek took possession of some of their tents; whereupon the Moslems were about to break and retreat and take flight, when meanwhile behold, up came Sharrkan with the rest of the host of Al-Islam and the standards of the Believers in Unity. And having come up with them, he charged the Infidels; and followed him Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the Emirs Bahram and Rustam with his brother Tarkash. When the foe saw this, they lost head and their reason fled, and the dust clouds towered till they covered the country whilst the righteous Believers joined their pious comrades. Then Sharrkan accosted the Chamberlain and praised him for his steadfastness; and he in turn gave the Prince joy of his timely succour and his gaining the day. Thereat the Moslems were glad and their hearts were heartened; so they rushed upon their enemies and devoted themselves to Allah in their Fight for the Faith. But when the Idolaters beheld the standards Mohammedan and there on the profession of Faith Islamitan, proclaiming the Unity, they shrieked ""Woe!"" and ""Ruin!"" and besought succour of the Patriarchs of the Monasteries. Then fell they to calling upon John and Mary and the Cross abhorrent and stayed their hands from slaughter, whilst King Afridun went up to consult King Hardub of Greece, for the two Kings stood one at the head of each wing, right and left. Now there was with them also a famous cavalier, Lawiya highs, who commanded the centre; and they drew out in battle array, but indeed they were full of alarm and affray. Meanwhile, the Moslems aligned their forces and thereupon Sharrkan came to his brother, Zau al-Makan, and said, ""O King of the Age, doubtless they mean to champion it, and that is also the object of our desire; but it is my wish to push forward the stoutest hearted of our fighters, for by forethought is one half of life wrought."" Replied the Sultan, ""As thou wilt, O companion of good counsel!"" ""It is my wish,"" added Sharrkan, ""to stand in mid line opposite the Infidel, with the Wazir Dandan on my left and thee on my right, whilst the Emir Bahram leads the dexter wing and the Emir Rustam leads the wing sinistral; and thou, O mighty King, shalt be under the standards and the ensigns, for that thou art the pillar of our defence; upon thee, after Allah, is our dependence and we will all be thy ransom from aught that can harm thee."" Zau al-Makan thanked him therefor, and the slogan arose and the sabre was drawn; but, as things stood thus, behold, there came forth a cavalier from the ranks of Roum; and, as he drew near, they saw that he was mounted on a slow paced she mule, fleeing with her master from the shock of swords. Her housings were of white silk covered by a prayer-carpet of Cash mere stuff, and on her back sat a Shaykh, an old man of comely presence and reverend aspect, garbed in a gown of white wool. He stinted not pushing her and hurrying her on till he came near the Moslem and said, ""I am an ambassador to you all, and an ambassador hath naught to do save to deliver; so give me safe conduct and permit of speech, that I communicate to you my message."" Replied Sharrkan, ""Thou art in safety: fear neither sway of sword nor lunge of lance."" Thereupon the old man dismounted and, taking the Cross from his neck, placed it before the Sultan and humbled himself with much humility. Then quoth to him the Moslems, ""What is with thee of news?""; and quoth he, ""I am an ambassador from King Afridun, for I counselled him to avert the destruction of all these frames of men and temples of the Compassionate One; and to him it seemed righteous to stay the shedding of blood and limit it to the encounter of two knights in shock of fight singular; so he agreed to that and he saith to you, 'Verily, I will ransom my army with my life; so let the Moslem King do as I do and with his life ransom his host. And if he kill me, there will be no stay left in the army of Roum, and if I kill him, there will be no stability with the Moslems."" When Sharrkan heard this he said, ""O monk, I agree to that, for it is just nor may it be gainsaid; and behold, I will meet him in duello and do with him derring do, for I am Champion of the Faithful even as he is Champion of the Faithless; and if he slay me, he will have won the day and naught will remain for the Moslems forces save flight. So return to him, O thou monk, and say that the single combat shall take place to morrow, for this day we have come off our journey and are aweary; but after rest neither reproach nor blame fear ye."" So the monk returned (and he rejoicing) to King Afridun and King Hardub, and told them both what Sharrkan had said, whereat King Afridun was glad with exceeding gladness and fell from him anxiety and sadness, and he said to himself, ""No doubt but this Sharrkan is their doughtiest swayer of the sword and the dourest at lunge of lance; and when I shall have slain him, their hearts will be disheartened and their strength will be shattered."" Now Zat al-Dawahi had written to King Afridun of that and had told him how Sharrkan was a Knight of the Braves and the bravest of knights and had warned him against him; but Afridun was a stalwart cavalier who fought in many a fashion; he could hurl rocks and throw spears and smite with the iron mace and he feared not the prowess of the prow. So when he heard the report of the monk that Sharrkan agreed to the duello, he was like to fly for exceeding joy because he had self confidence and he knew that none could with stand him. The Infidels passed that night in joy and jubilee and wine bibbing; and, as soon as it was dawn, the two armies drew out with the swart of spear and the blanch of blade. And behold a cavalier rode single handed into the plain, mounted on a steed of purest strain, and for foray and fray full ready and fain. And that Knight had limbs of might and he was clad in an iron cuirass made for stress of fight. On his breast he wore a jewelled mirror and in his hand he bore a keen scymitar and his lance of Khalanj wood,[FN#446] the curious work of the Frank, weighing a quintal. Then the rider uncovered his face and cried out, saying, ""Whoso knoweth me verily hath enough of me, and whoso knoweth me not right soon[FN#447] shall ken who I be. I am Afridun the overwhelmed by the well omened Shaw√°hi,[FN#448] Zat al-Dawahi."" But he had not ended speaking ere Sharrkan, the Champion of the Moslems, fared forth to meet him, mounted on a sorrel horse worth a thousand pieces of red gold with accoutrements purfled in pearls and precious stone; and he bore in baldrick a blade of watered Indian steel that through necks shore and made easy the hard and sore. He crave his charger between the two hosts in line whilst the horsemen all fixed on him their eyne, and he cried out to Afridun, ""Woe to thee, O accursed! dost thou deem me one of the horsemen thou hast overta'en who cannot stand against thee on battle plain?"" Then each rushed upon other and they bashed together like two mountains crashing or two billows dash ing and clashing: they advanced and retreated; and drew together and withdrew; and stinted not of fray and fight and weapon play, and strife and stay, with stroke of sword and lunge of lance. Of the two armies looking on, some said, ""Sharrkan is victor!"" and others, ""Afridun will conquer!""; and the two riders stayed not their hands from the hustle until ceased the clamour and the bustle; and the dust columns rose and the day waned and the sun waxed yellow and wan. Then cried out King Afridun to Sharrkan, saying, ""By the truth of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar, thou art nought save a doughty rider and a stalwart fighter; but thou art fraudful and thy nature is not that of the noble. I ken thy work is other than praiseworthy nor is thy prowess that of a Prince; for thy people behave to thee as though thou wert a slave;[FN#449] and see! they bring thee out a charger which is not thine, that thou mayst mount and return to the fight. But by the truth of my Faith, thy fighting irketh and fatigueth me and I am weary of cutting and thrusting with thee; and if thou purpose to lay on load with me to night, thou wouldst not change aught of thy harness nor thy horse, till thou approve to the cavaliers, thy generous blood and skill in brunt."" When Sharrkan heard him say these words concerning his own folk behaving to him though he were a slave, he waxt wroth and turned towards his men, meaning to sign to them and bid them not prepare him change of harness or horse, when lo! Afridun shook his throw spear high in air and cast it at Sharrkan. Now when the Moslem turned his back, he found none of the men near him, and he knew this to be a trick of the accursed Infidel; so he wheeled round in haste and behold, the javelin came at him, so he swerved from it, till his head was bent low as his saddle bow. The weapon grazed his breast, and pierced the skin of his chest, for Sharrkan was high bosomed: whereupon he gave one cry and swooned away. Thereat the accursed Afridun was joyful, thinking he had slain him; and shouted to the Infidels bidding them rejoice, whereat the Faithless were encouraged and the Faithful wept. When Zau al-Makan saw his brother reeling in selle so that he well nigh fell, he despatched cavaliers towards him and the braves hurried to his aid and came up with him. Thereupon the Infidels drove at the Moslems; the two hosts joined battle and the two lines were mingled, whilst the keen scymitar of Al-Yaman did good work. Now the first to reach Sharrkan was the Wazir Dandan,‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Third Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Zau al-Makan saw that the accursed Infidel had struck with javelin his brother Sharrkan, he deemed him dead, and despatched cavaliers towards him; and the first to reach him were the Wazir Dandan and the Emir of the Turks, Bahram, and the Emir of the Daylamites, Rustam. They found him falling from his horse; so they stayed him in his saddle and returned with him to his brother, Zau al-Makan; then they gave him in charge to his pages, and went again to do the work of cut and thrust. So the strife redoubled and the weapons together clashed and ceased not bate and debate and naught was to be seen but blood flowing and necks bowing; nor did the swords cease on the napes of men to make play nor the strife to rage with more and more affray, till the most part of the night was past away and the two hosts were aweary of the mellay. So they called a truce and each army returned to its tents, whilst all the Infidels repaired to King Afridun and kissed the ground before him, and the priests and monks wished him joy of his victory over Sharrkan. Then the King fared for Constantinople and sat upon the throne of his realm, when King Hardub came to him and said, ""May the Messiah strengthen thy fore arm and never cease to be thy helper and hearken to what prayers my pious mother, Zat al-Dawahi, shall pray for thee! Know that the Moslems can make no stay without Sharrkan."" Replied Afridun, ""To morrow shall end the affair when to fight I fare: I will seek Zau al-Makan and slay him, and their army shall turn tail and of flight shall avail."" Such was the case with the Kafirs; but as regards the host of Al-Islam, when Zau al-Makan returned to his tent, he thought of naught but his brother and, going into the pavilion, found him in evil case and sore condition; whereupon he summoned for counsel the Wazir Dandan and Rustam and Bahram. When they entered, they opined to assemble the physicians that they might medicine Sharrkan, and they wept and said, ""The world will not readily afford his like!"" and they watched by him all that night, and about the later hours came to them the Recluse in tears. When Zau al-Makan saw him, he rose in honour; and the Religious stroked Sharrkan's wound with his hand, chanting somewhat of the Koran and repeating by way of talisman some of the verses of the Compassionate One. And the pretender ceased not to watch over him till dawn, when he came to himself and, opening his eyes, moved his tongue in his mouth and spake. At this Zau al-Makan rejoiced, saying, ""Of a truth the blessing of the Holy Man hath taken effect on him!"" And Sharrkan said, ""Praised be Allah for recovery; indeed, I am well at this hour. That accursed one played me false; and, but that I swerved aside lighter than lightening, the throw spear had pierced through my breast. So praised be Allah for saving me! And how is it with the Moslems?"" Answered Zau al-Makan, ""All are weeping for thee."" Quoth Sharrkan, ""I am well and in good case; but where is the Holy Man?"" Now he was sitting by him and said, ""At thy head."" So the Prince turned to him and kissed his hand when he said, ""O my son! Be of good patience and Allah shall increase thy reward; for the wage is measured by the work."" Sharrkan rejoined, ""Pray for me,"" and he prayed for him. As soon as morning dawned and day brake in shine and sheen, the Moslems sallied out to the plain and the Kafirs made ready to thrust and cut. Then the Islamite host advanced and offered fight with weapons ready dight, and King Zau al-Makan and Afridun made to charge one at other. But when Zau al-Makan fared forth into the field, there came with him the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain and Bahram, saying, ""We will be thy sacrifice."" He replied, ""By the Holy House and Zemzem and the Place![FN#450] I will not be stayed from going forth against these wild asses."" And when he rode out into the field he played with sword and spear till riders marvelled and both armies wondered; then he rushed upon the foe's right wing and of it slew two knights and in like manner he dealt with the left wing. Presently he stayed his steed in the midst of the field and cried out, ""Where is Afridun, that I may make him taste the cup of disgrace?"" But when King Hardub saw the case he conjured Afridun not to attack him, saying, ""O King, yesterday it was thy turn to fight: it is mine to day. I care naught for his prowess."" So he rushed out towards Zau al-Makan brand in hand and under him a stallion like Abjar, which was Antar's charger and its coat was jet black even as saith the poet,

""On the glancing racer outracing glance * He speeds, as though he
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    would collar Doom:
His steed's black coat is of darkest jet, * And likest Night in
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    her nightliest gloom:
Whose neigh sounds glad to the hearer's ears * Like thunders
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     rolling in thun d'rous boom:
If he race the wind he will lead the way, * And the lightning
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     flash will behind him loom.''[FN#451]

Then each rushed upon the opponent, parrying blows and proving the marvellous qualities were stored in him; and they fell to drawing on and withdrawing till the breasts of the bystanders were straitened and they were weary of waiting for the event. At last Zau al-Makan cried out his war cry and rushed upon Hardub, King of C√¶sarea,[FN#452] and struck him a stroke that shore head from trunk and slew him on the spot. When the Infidels saw this, they charged in a body, compact and united, upon Zau al-Makan, who met them amidfield, and they engaged in hewing and foining, till blood ran in rills. Then the Moslems cried out, ""Allaho Akbar!"" (God is most Great) and ""There is no god but the God!"", and invoked salvation for the Prophet, the Bringer of Glad Tidings, the Bearer of Bad Tidings. And there befel a great fight, but Allah assigned victory to the Faithful and defeat to the Faithless. The Wazir Dandan shouted, ""Take your blood revenge for King Omar bin al Nu'uman and his son Sharrkan!""; and bared his head and cried out to the Turks. Now there were by his side more than twenty thousand horse, and all charged with him as men, when the Faithless found naught to save their lives but flight. So they turned tail to fly while the biting sabre wrought its havoc and the Moslems slew of them that day some fifty thousand horse and took more than that number: much folk also were slain while going in at the gates, for the flock was great. Then the Greeks hove to the doors and swarmed up the walls to await the assault; and in fine the Moslem hosts returned to their tents aided to glory and victory, and King Zau al-Makan went in to his brother whom he found in most joyous case. So he made a prostration of thanks to the Bountiful and the Exalted; and then he came forward and gave Sharrkan joy of his recovery. Answered he, ""Verily we are all under the benediction of this Religious, holy and righteous, nor would you have been victorious, but for his accepted orisons; indeed all day he remained at prayer to invoke victory on the Moslems.""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Zau al- Makan went in to his brother Sharrkan, he found him sitting with the Holy Man by his side; so he rejoiced and drew near him and gave him joy of his recovery. Answered he, ""Verily we are all under the benediction of this Recluse nor would you have been victorious but for his prayers, indeed he felt no fear this day and he ceased not supplication for the Moslems. I found strength return to me, when I heard your 'Allaho Akbar,' for then I knew you to be victorious over your enemies. But now recount to me, O my brother, what befel thee."" So he told him all that had passed between him and the accursed Hardub and related how he had slain him and sent him to the malediction of Allah; and Sharrkan praised him and thanked him for his prowess. When Zat al-Dawahi heard tell of her son's death (and she still drest as a devotee), her face waxed yellow and her eyes ran over with railing tears: she kept her counsel, however, and feigned to the Moslems that she was glad and wept for excess of joy. But she said to herself, ""By the truth of the Messiah, there remaineth no profit of my life, if I burn not his heart for his brother, Sharrkan, even as he hath burned my heart for King Hardub, the mainstay of Christendom and the hosts of Crossdom!"" Still she kept her secret. And the Wazir Dandan and King Zau al-Makan and the Chamberlain remained sitting with Sharrkan till they had dressed and salved his wound; after which they gave him medicines and he began to recover strength; whereat they joyed with exceeding joy and told the troops who congratulated themselves, saying, ""To morrow he will ride with us and do manly devoir in the siege."" Then said Sharrkan to them, ""Ye have fought through all this day and are aweary of fight; so it behoveth that you return to your places and sleep and not sit up."" They accepted his counsel and then each went away to his own pavilion, and none remained with Sharrkan but a few servants and the old woman Zat al-Dawahi. He talked with her through part of the night, then he stretched himself to rest: and his servants did likewise and presently sleep overcame them all and they lay like the dead. Such was the case with Sharrkan and his men; but as regards the old woman she alone abode awake while they slumbered in the tent and, looking at Sharrkan she presently saw that he was drowned in sleep. Thereupon she sprang to her feet, as she were a scald she bear or a speckled snake, and drew from her waist cloth a dagger so poisoned that if laid thereon it would have melted a rock. Then she unsheathed the poniard and went up to Sharrkan's head and she drew the knife across his throat and severed his weasand and hewed off his head from his body. And once more she sprang to her feet; and, going the round of the sleeping servants, she cut off their heads also, lest they should awake. Then she left the tent and made for the Sultan's pavilion, but finding the guards on the alert, turned to that of the Wazir Dandan. Now she found him reading the Koran and when his sight fell upon her he said, ""Welcome to the Holy Man!"" Hearing this from the Wazir, her heart trembled and she said, ""The reason of my coming hither at this time is that I heard the voice of a saint amongst Allah's Saints and am going to him."" Then she turned her back, but the Wazir said to himself, ""By Allah, I will follow our Devotee this night!"" So he rose and walked after her; but when the accursed old woman sensed his footsteps, she knew that he was following her: wherefore she feared the disgrace of discovery and said in herself, ""Unless I serve some trick upon him he will disgrace me."" So she turned and said to him from afar, ""Ho, thou Wazir, I am going in search of this Saint that I may learn who he is; and, after learning this much, I will ask his leave for thee to visit him. Then I will come back and tell thee: for I fear thine accompanying me, without having his permission, lest he take umbrage at me seeing thee in my society."" Now when the Wazir heard these words, he was ashamed to answer her; so he left her and returned to his tent, and would have slept; but sleep was not favourable to him and the world seemed heaped upon him. Presently he rose and went forth from the tent saying in himself, ""I will go to Sharrkan and chat with him till morning."" But when he entered into Sharrkan's pavilion, he found the blood running like an aqueduct and saw the servants lying with their throats cut like beasts for food. At this he cried a cry which aroused all who were asleep; the folk hastened to him and, seeing the blood streaming, set up a clamour of weeping and wailing. Then the noise awoke the Sultan, who enquired what was the matter, and it was said to him, ""Sharrkan thy brother and his servants are murthered."" So he rose in haste and entered the tent, and found the Wazir Dandan shrieking aloud and he saw his brother's body without a head. Thereat he swooned away and all the troops crowded around him, weeping and crying out, and so remained for a while, till he came to himself, when he looked at Sharrkan and wept with sore weeping, while the Wazir and Rustam and Bahram did the like. But the Chamberlain cried and lamented more than the rest and asked leave to absent himself, such was his alarm. Then said Zau al-Makan, ""Know ye who did this deed and how is it I see not the Devotee, him who the things of this world hath put away?"" Quoth the Wazir, ""And who should have been the cause of this affliction, save that Devotee, that Satan? By Allah, my heart abhorred him from the first, because I know that all who pretend to be absorbed in practices religious are vile and treacherous!"" And he repeated to the King the tale of how he would have followed the Religious, but he forbade him, whereupon the folk broke out into a tumult of weeping and lamentation and humbled themselves before Him who is ever near, Him who ever answereth prayer, supplicating that He would cause the false Devotee who denied Allah's testimony to fall into their hands. Then they laid Sharrken out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his far-famed virtues.‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they laid Sharrkan out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his far-famed virtues. Then they looked for the opening of the city gate; but it opened not and no sign of men appeared to them on the walls; whereat they wondered with exceeding wonder. But King Zau al-Makan said, ""By Allah, I will not turn back from them, though I sit here for years and years, till I take blood revenge for my brother Sharrkan and waste Constantinople and kill the King of the Nazarenes, even if death overcome me and I be at rest from this woeful world!"" Then he bade be brought out the treasure taken from the Monastery of Matruhina; and mustered the troops and divided the monies among them, and he left not one of them but he gave him gifts which contented him. Moreover, he assembled in the presence three hundred horse of every division and said to them, ""Do ye send supplies to your households, for I am resolved to abide by this city, year after year, till I have taken man bote for my brother Sharrkan, even if I die in this stead."" And when the army heard these words and had received his gifts of money they replied, ""To hear is to obey!"" Thereupon he summoned couriers and gave them letters and charged them to deliver the same, together with the monies, to the soldiers' families and inform them that all were safe and satisfied, and acquaint them saying, ""We are encamped before Constantinople and we will either destroy it or die; and, albeit we be obliged to abide here months and years, we will not depart hence till we take it."" Moreover, he bade the Wazir Dandan write to his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, and said to him, ""Acquaint her with what hath befallen us, and what be our situation and commend my child to her care since that, when I went out to war, my wife was near her delivery and by this time she must needs have been brought to bed; and if she hath given birth to a boy, as I have heard say, hasten your return and bring me the acceptable news."" Then he gave them somewhat of money, which they pouched and set out at once; and all the people flocked forth to take leave of them and entrust them with the monies and the messages. After they had departed, Zau al-Makan turned to the Wazir Dandan and commanded him to advance with the army against the city walls. So the troops pushed forward, but found none on the ramparts, whereat they marvelled, while Zau al-Makan was troubled at the case, for he deeply mourned the severance from his brother Sharrkan and he was sore perturbed about that traitor the Ascetic. In this condition they abode three days without seeing anyone. So far concerning the Moslems; but as regards the Greeks and the cause of their refusing to fight during these three days the case was this. As soon as Zat al-Dawahi had slain Sharrkan, she hastened her march and reached the walls of Constantinople, where she called out in the Greek tongue to the guards to throw her down a rope. Quoth they, ""Who art thou?""; and quoth she, ""I am Zat al- Dawahi."" They knew her and let down a cord to which she tied herself and they drew her up; and, when inside the city, she went in to the King Afridun and said to him, ""What is this I hear from the Moslems? They say that my son King Hardub is slain."" He answered, ""Yes;"" and she shrieked out and wept right grievously and ceased not weeping thus till she made Afridun and all who were present weep with her. Then she told the King how she had slain Sharrkan and thirty of his servants, whereat he rejoiced and thanked her; and, kissing her hands, exhorted her to resignation for the loss of her son. Said she, ""By the truth of the Messiah, I will not rest content with killing that dog of the Moslem dogs in blood revenge for my son, a King of the Kings of the age! Now there is no help for it but that I work some guile and I contrive a wile whereby to slay the Sultan Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain and Rustam and Bahram and ten thousand cavaliers of the army of Al-Islam; for it shall never be said that my son's head be paid with the bloodwit of Sharrkan's head; no, never!"" Then said she to King Afridun, ""Know, O King of the Age, that it is my wish to set forth mourning for my son and to cut my Girdle and to break the Crosses."" Replied Afridun, ""Do what thou desire; I will not gainsay thee in aught. And if thou prolong thy mourning for many days it were a little thing; for though the Moslems resolve to beleaguer us years and years, they will never win their will of us nor gain aught of us save trouble and weariness."" Then the Accursed One (when she had ended with the calamity she had wrought and the ignominies which in herself she had thought) took ink case and paper and wrote thereon: ""From Shawahi, Zat al- Dawahi, to the host of the Moslems. Know ye that I entered your country and duped by my cunning your nobles and at first hand I slew your King Omar bin al-Nu'uman in the midst of his palace. Moreover, I slew, in the affair of the mountain pass and of the cave, many of your men; and the last I killed were Sharrkan and his servants. And if fortune do not stay me and Satan obey me, I needs must slay me your Sultan and the Wazir Dandan, for I am she who came to you in disguise of a Recluse and who heaped upon you my devices and deceits. Wherefore, an you would be in safety after this, fare ye forth at once; and if you seek your own destruction cease not abiding for the nonce; and though ye tarry here years and years, ye shall not do your desire on us. And so peace be yours!"" After writing her writ she devoted three days to mourning for King Hardub; arid, on the fourth, she called a Knight and bade him take the letter and make it fast to a shaft and shoot it into the Moslem camp. When this was done, she entered the church and gave herself up to weeping and wailing for the loss of her son, saying to him who took the kingship after him, ""Nothing will serve me but I must kill Zau al-Makan and all the nobles of Al-Islam."" Such was the case with her; but as regards what occurred to the Moslems, all passed three days in trouble and anxiety, and on the fourth when gazing at the walls behold, they saw a knight holding a bow and about to shoot an arrow along whose side a letter was bound. So they waited till he had shot it among them and the Sultan bade the Wazir Dandan take the missive and read it. He perused it accordingly; and, when Zau al-Makan heard it to end and understood its purport, his eyes filled with tears and he shrieked for agony at her perfidy; and the Minister Dandan said, ""By Allah, my heart shrank from her!"" Quoth the Sultan, ""How could this whore play her tricks upon us twice? But by the Almighty I will not depart hence till I fill her cleft with molten lead and jail her with the jailing of a bird encaged, then bind her with her own hair and crucify her over the gate of Constantinople."" And he called to mind his brother and wept with excessive weeping. But when Zat al-Dawahi arrived amongst the Infidels and related to them her adventures at length, they rejoiced at her safety and at the slaying of Sharrkan. There upon the Moslems addressed themselves again to the siege of the city and the Sultan promised his men that, if it should be taken, he would divide its treasures among them in equal parts. But he dried not his tears grieving for his brother till his body was wasted and sick, growing thin as a tooth pick. Presently the Wazir Dandan came in to him and said, ""Be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear; in very sooth thy brother died not but because his hour was come, and there is no profit in this mourning. How well saith the poet,

""Whatso is not to be no sleight shall bring to pass; * What is to
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     be without a failure shall become;
Soon the becoming fortune shall be found to be, * And Folly's
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     brother[FN#453] shall abide forlorn and glum.""

Wherefore do thou leave this weeping and wailing and hearten thy heart to bear arms."" He replied, ""O Wazir, my heart is heavy for the death of my father and my brother and for our absence from hearth and home; and my mind is concerned for my subjects."" Thereupon the Wazir and the bystanders wept; but they ceased not from pushing forward the siege of Constantinople for a length of days. And they being thus, behold, news arrived from Baghdad, by one of the Emirs to the effect that the King's wife had been blessed with a boy, and that his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, had named him K√°nm√°k√°n.[FN#454] Moreover, that the boy bid fair to be famous, already showing wondrous signs and marvellous tokens; and that she had commanded the Olema and the preachers to pray for mother and child from the pulpits and bless them in all wise; furthermore that the twain were well, that the land had enjoyed abundant rains, and that his comrade the Fireman was established in all prosperity, with eunuchs and slaves to wait upon him; but that he was still ignorant of what had befallen him. And she ended with the greeting of peace. Then quoth Zau al- Makan to the Wazir Dandan, ""Now is my back strengthened for that I have been blest with a son whose name is Kanmakan.""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when they brought him the news of his wife having borne him a boy child, Zau al- Makan rejoiced with great joy and cried, ""Now is my back strengthened, for that I have been blessed with a son[FN#455] whose name is Kanmakan."" And he spake to the Wazir Dandan, saying, ""I am minded to leave this mourning and order perfections of the Koran for my brother and command almsdeeds on his account."" Quoth the Wazir, ""Thy design is good."" Thereupon he caused tents to be pitched over his brother's tomb; so they raised them and gathered together such of the men at arms as could repeat the Koran; and some began reciting the Holy volume; whilst others chanted litanies containing the names of Allah, and thus they did till the morning. Then Zau al-Makan went up to the grave of his brother Sharrkan and poured forth copious tears, and improvised these couplets,

""They bore him bier'd, and all who followed wept * With Moses'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† shrieks what day o'erhead shook Tor;[FN#456]
Till reached the grave which Pate had made his home, * Dug in
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   men's souls who one sole God adore:
Ne'er had I thought before to see my joy * Borne on the bier
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   which heads of bearers bore:
Ah no! nor ere they homed thee in the dust * That stars of
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   heaven earth ever covered o'er.
Is the tomb dweller hostage of a stead, * Where light and
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    splendour o'er thy face shall pour?
Praise to restore his life her word hath pledged: * Cribbed and
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   confined he shall dispread the more!""

When Zau al-Makan had made an end of his versifying he wept and wept with him all the troops; then he came to the grave and threw himself upon it wild with woe, and the Wazir repeated the words of the poet,

""Pain leaving life that fleets thou hast th' eternal won; * Thou
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    didst as whilom many a doer like thee hath done
Leftest this worldly house without reproach or blame; * Ah, may
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    th' ex change secure thee every benison!
Thou west from hostile onset shield and firm defence, * For us to
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    baffle shafts and whistling spears to shun.
I see this world is only cheat and vanity, * Where man naught
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   else must seek but please the Truthful One:
Th' Empyrean's Lord allow thee bower of heavenly bliss, * And wi'
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    thy faithful friends The Guide show goodly wone:
I bid thee last good e'en with sigh of bitter grief, * Seeing the
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     West in woe for lack of Easting Sun.""


When the Wazir Dandan had finished his reciting, he wept with sore weeping and the tears rained from his eyes like cushioned pearls. Then came forward one who had been of Sharrkan's boon companions in his cups and he wept till ran in rills the drops, and he enumerated the dead man's generous qualities, reciting the following pentastichs,


""Where gone is Bounty since thy hand is turned to clay? * And I
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     in misery lie since thou west ta'en away.
See'st not, O litter guide[FN#457] (Heaven keep thee glad and
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     gay!), * How tears adorn my cheeks, these furrowed wrinkles
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     fray?
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†        A sight to joy shine eyes and fill thee with
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†        dismay.[FN#458]
By Allah ne'er this heart within I spoke of thee; * Ah no! nor
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     dared my sight to see thy brilliancy:
Save that my tear drops sorest wound have garred me dree * Yea!
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     and if e'er on other rest these eyne of me,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†        May yearning draw their reins nor suffer sleep to see.""


And when the man stinted reciting, Zau al-Makan and the Minister Dandan wept and the whole army was moved to tears; after which all retired to their tents, and the King turning to the Wazir took counsel with him concerning the conduct of the campaign. On this wise the two passed days and nights, while Zau al-Makan was weighed down with grief and mourning till at last he said, ""I long to hear stories and adventures of Kings and tales of lover folk enslaved by love; haply Allah may make this to solace that which is on my heart of heavy anxiety, and stint and stay my weeping and wailing."" Quoth the Wazir, ""If naught can dispel thy trouble but hearing curious tales of Kings and people long gone before and stories of folk enslaved by love of yore, and so forth, this thing were easy, for I had no other business, in the lifetime of thy father (who hath found mercy) than to relate stories and to repeat verses to him. This very night I will tell thee a tale of a lover and his beloved, so shall thy breast be broadened."" When Zau al-Makan heard these words from the Minister, his heart was set upon that which had been promised to him and he did nothing but watch for the coming of the night, that he might hear what the Wazir Dandan had to tell of the Kings of yore and distracted lovers long gone before. And hardly would he believe that night had fallen ere he bade light the wax candles and the lamps and bring all that was needful of meat and drink and perfume gear, and what not; and when all was in presence, he summoned the Wazir Dandan, and the Emirs Rustam and Bahram and Tarkash and the Grand Chamberlain; then waited till the whole party was seated before him; whereupon he turned to the Minister and said, ""Know, O Wazir, that night is come and hath let down over us its veil of gloom, and we desire that thou tell us those tales which thou promisedst us."" Replied the Wazir, ""With joy and good will.""‚ÄîAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Zau Al-Makan summoned the Wazir and the Chamberlain and Rustam and Bahram, he turned towards the Minister Dandan and said, ""Know, O Wazir, that night is come and hath let down over us its veil of gloom, and we desire that thou tell us those tales which thou promisedst us."" Replied the Wazir, ""With love and gladness! Know, O auspicious King, that there reached my ears a relation of a lover and a loved one and of the discourse between them and what befel them of things rare and fair, a story such as repelleth care from the heart and dispelleth sorrow like unto that of the patriarch Jacob[FN#459]; and it is as follows"":

Footnotes:


[FN#138] This knightly tale, the longest in the Nights (xliv.‚Äî cxlv.), about one-eighth of the whole, does not appear in the Bres. Edit. Lane, who finds it ""objectionable,"" reduces it to two of its episodes, Az√≠z-cum-Az√≠zah and T√°j al-Mul√∫k. On the other hand it has been converted into a volume (8vo, pp. 240) ""Scharkan, Conte Arabe,"" etc. Traduit par M. Asselan Riche, etc. Paris: Dondey-Dupr√©. 1829. It has its longueurs and at times is longsome enough; but it is interesting as a comparison between the chivalry of Al-Islam and European knight-errantry. Although all the characters are fictitious the period is evidently in the early crusading days. C√¶sarea, the second capital of Palestine, taken during the Caliphate of Omar (A.H. 19) and afterwards recovered, was fortified in A.H. 353 = 963 as a base against the Arabs by the Emperor Phocas, the Arab. ""Nakf√∫r"" i.e. Nicephorus. In A.H. 498=1104, crusading craft did much injury by plundering merchantmen between Egypt and Syria, to which allusion is found in the romance. But the story teller has not quite made up his mind about which C√¶sarea he is talking, and M. Riche tells us that C√©sar√©e is a ""ville de la Mauritanie, en Afrique"" (p. 20).

[FN#139] The fifth Ommiade Caliph reign. A.H. 65-86 = 685-704.

[FN#140] This does not merely mean that no one was safe from his wrath: or, could approach him in the heat of fight: it is a reminiscence of the masterful ""King Kulayb,"" who established game-laws in his dominions and would allow no man to approach his camp-fire. Moreover the Jinn lights a fire to decoy travellers, but if his victim be bold enough to brave him, he invites him to take advantage of the heat.

[FN#141] China.

[FN#142] The Jaxartes and the Bactrus (names very loosely applied).

[FN#143] In full ""Sharrun k√°na"" i.e. an evil (Sharr) has come to being (k√°na) that is, ""bane to the foe"" a pagan and knightly name. The hero of the Romance ""Al-Dalhamah"" is described as a bitter gourd (colocynth), a viper, a calamity.

[FN#144] This is a Moslem law (Koran chaps. iv. bodily borrowed from the Talmud) which does not allow a man to marry one wife unless he can carnally satisfy her. Moreover he must distribute his honours equally and each wife has a right to her night unless she herself give it up. This was the case even with the spouses of the Prophet; and his biography notices several occasions when his wives waived their rights in favour of one another M. Riche kindly provides the King with la piquante francaise (p. 15).

[FN#145] So the celebrated mosque in Stambul, famed for being the largest church in the world is known to the Greeks as ""Agia (pron. Aya) Sophia"" and to Moslems as ""Aye Sof√≠yeh"" (Holy Wisdom) i.e. the Logos or Second Person of the Trinity (not a Saintess). The sending a Christian girl as a present to a Moslem would, in these days, be considered highly scandalous. But it was done by the Mukaukis or Coptic Governor of Egypt (under Heraclius) who of course hated the Greeks. This worthy gave two damsels to Mohammed; one called S√≠r√≠n and the other M√°riyah (Maria) whom the Prophet reserved for his especial use and whose abode is still shown at Al-Medinah. The Rev. Doctor Badger (loc. cit. p. 972) gives the translation of an epistle by Mohammed to this Mukaukis, written in the Cufic character ( ? ?) and sealed ""Mohammed, The Apostle of Allah."" My friend seems to believe that it is an original, but upon this subject opinions will differ. It is, however, exceedingly interesting, beginning with ""Bismillah,"" etc., and ending (before the signature) with a quotation from the Koran (iii. 57); and it may be assumed as a formula addressee to foreign potentates by a Prophet who had become virtually ""King of Arabia.""

[FN#146] This prayer before ""doing the deed of kind"" is, I have said, Moslem as well Christian.

It is the ""groaning-chair"" of Poor Robin's Almanac (1676) and we find it alluded to in Boccaccio, the classical sedile which according to scoffers has formed the papal chair (a curule seat) ever since the days of Pope Joan, when it has been held advisable for one of the Cardinals to ascertain that His Holiness possesses all the instruments of virility. This ""Kurs√≠ al-wil√°dah"" is of peculiar form on which the patient is seated. A most interesting essay might be written upon the various positions preferred during delivery, e.g. the wild Irish still stand on all fours, like the so-called ""lower animals."" Amongst the Moslems of Waday, etc., a cord is hung from the top of the hut, and the woman in labour holds on to it standing with her legs apart, till the midwife receives the child.

[FN#148] Some Orientalists call ""lullilooing"" the trilling cry, which is made by raising the voice to its highest pitch and breaking it by a rapid succession of touches on the palate with the tongue-tip, others ""Ziraleet"" and Zagaleet, and one traveller tells us that it began at the marriage-festival of Isaac and Rebecca (!). Arabs term it classically ""Tahl√≠l"" and vulgarly ""Zaghrutah"" (Plur. Zagh√°rit) and Persians ""Kil."" Finally in Don Quixote we have ""Lelilies,"" the battle-cry of the Moors (Duffield iii. 289). Dr. Buchanan likens it to a serpent uttering human sounds, but the good missionary heard it at the festival of Jagannath. (Pilgrimage iii. 197 )

[FN#149] i.e. ""Light of the Place"" (or kingdom) and ""Delight of the

[FN#150] It is utterly absurd to give the old heroic Persian name Afridun or Furaydun, the destroyer of Zoh√°k or Zahh√°k to a Greek, but such anachronisms are characteristic of The Nights and are evidently introduced on purpose. See Boccaccio, ix. 9.

[FN#152] In 1870 I saw at Sidon a find of some hundreds of gold
""Philippi"" and ""Alexanders.""

[FN#153] M. Riche has (p. 21), ""Ces talismans travaill√©s par le ciseau du c√©l√®bre Califaziri,"" adding in a note, ""Je pense que c'est un sculpteur Arabe.""

[FN#154] This periphrase, containing what seems to us a useless negative, adds emphasis in Arabic.

[FN#155] This bit of geographical information is not in the Bull
Edit.

[FN#156] In Pers. = a tooth, the popular word.

[FN#157] This preliminary move, called in Persian Nakl-i Safar, is generally mentioned. So the Franciscan monks in California, when setting out for a long journey through the desert, marched three times round the convent and pitched tents for the night under its walls.

[FN#158] In Arab. ""Khazinah"" or ""Khaznah"" lit. a treasure, representing 1,000 ""K√≠s"" or purses (each=¬£5). The sum in the text is 7,000 purses X 5=¬£35,000.

[FN#159] Travellers often prefer such sites because they are sheltered from the wind, and the ground is soft for pitching tents; but many have come to grief from sudden torrents following rain.

[FN#160] Arab ""Gh√°bah"" not a forest in our sense of the word, but a place where water sinks and the trees (mostly Mimosas), which elsewhere are widely scattered, form a comparatively dense growth and collect in thickets. These are favourite places for wild beasts during noon-heats.

[FN#161] At various times in the East Jews and Christians were ordered to wear characteristic garments, especially the Zunn√°r or girdle.

[FN#162] The description is borrowed from the Coptic Convent, which invariably has an inner donjon or keep. The oldest monastery in the world is Mar Antonios (St. Anthony the Hermit) not far from Suez. (Gold Mines of Midian, p. 85.)

[FN#163] ""Daw√°h√≠,"" plur. of D√°hiyah = a mishap. The title means ""Mistress of Misfortunes"" or Queen of Calamities (to the enemy); and the venerable lady, as will be seen, amply deserved her name, which is pronounced Z√°t al-Daw√°h√≠.

[FN#164] Arab. ""Kunfuz""=hedgehog or porcupine.

[FN#165] These flowers of speech are mere familiarities, not insults. In societies where the sexes are separated speech becomes exceedingly free. ""√âtourdie que vous √™tes,"" says M. Riche, toning down the text.

[FN#166] Arab. ""Zirt,"" a low word. The superlative ""Zarr√°t"" (fartermost) or, ""Abu Zirt"" (Father of farts) is a facetious term among the bean-eating Fellahs and a deadly insult amongst the Badawin (Night ccccx.). The latter prefer the word Tagg√°a (Pilgrimage iii. 84). We did not disdain the word in farthingale=pet en air.

[FN#167] Arab. ""kicked"" him, i.e. with the sharp corner of the shovel-stirrup. I avoid such expressions as ""spurring"" and ""pricking over the plain,"" because apt to give a wrong idea.

[FN#168] Arab. ""Allaho Akbar!"" the classical Moslem slogan.

[FN#169] Arab horses are never taught to leap, so she was quite safe on the other side of a brook nine feet broad.

[FN#170] ""Batr√≠k"" (vulg. Bitr√≠k)=patricius, a title given to
Christian knights who commanded ten thousand men; the Tarkhan (or
Nobb) heading four thousand, and the Kaumas (Arab. K√°id) two
hundred. It must not be confounded with Batrak (or
Batrik)=patriarcha. (Lane's Lex.)

[FN#171] Arab. ""K√°zi al-Kuz√°t,"" a kind of Chief Justice or Chancellor. The office wag established under the rule of Harun al Rashid, who so entitled Ab√∫ Y√∫suf Ya'akab al-Ans√°ri: therefore the allusion is anachronistic. The same Caliph also caused the Olema to dress as they do still.

[FN#172] The allusion is Koranic: ""O men, if ye be in doubt concerning the resurrection, consider that He first created you of the dust of the ground (Adam), afterwards of seed"" (chaps. xxii.). But the physiological ideas of the Koran are curious. It supposes that the Mani or male semen is in the loins and that of women in the breast bone (chaps Ixxxvi.); that the mingled seed of the two (chaps. Ixxvi.) fructifies the ovary and that the child is fed through the navel with menstruous blood, hence the cessation of the catamenia. Barzoi (Kalilah and D√≠mnah) says:‚Äî ""Man's seed, falling into the woman's womb, is mixed with her seed and her blood: when it thickens and curdles the Spirit moves it and it turns about like liquid cheese; then it solidifies, its arteries are formed, its limbs constructed and its joints distinguished. If the babe is a male, his face is placed towards his mother's back; if a female, towards her belly."" (P. 262, Mr. L G.N. Keith- Falconer's translation.) But there is a curious prolepsis of the spermatozoa-theory. We read (Koran chaps. vii.), ""Thy Lord drew forth their posterity from the loins of the sons of Adam;"" and the commentators say that Allah stroked Adam's back and extracted from his loins all his posterity, which shall ever be, in the shape of small ants; these confessed their dependence on God and were dismissed to return whence they came."" From this fiction it appears (says Sale) that the doctrine of pre-existence is not unknown to the Mohammedans, and there is some little conformity between it and the modern theory of generatio ex animalculis in semine marium. The poets call this Yaum-i-Alast = the Day of Am-I-not (-your Lord)? which Sir William Jones most unhappily translated ""Art thou not with thy Lord ?"" (Alasta bi Rabbi- kum); fand they produce a grand vision of unembodied spirits appearing in countless millions before their Creator.

[FN#173] The usual preliminary of a wrestling bout.

[FN#174] In Eastern wrestling this counts as a fair fail. So Ajax fell on his back with Ulysses on his breast. (Iliad xxxii., 700, etc.)

[FN#175] So biting was allowed amongst the Greeks in the , the final struggle on the ground.

[FN#176] Supposed to be names of noted wrestlers. ""Kayim"" (not El-Kim as Torrens has it) is a term now applied to a juggler or ""professor"" of legerdemain who amuses people in the streets with easy tricks. (Lane, M. E., chaps. xx.)

[FN#177] Lit. ""laughed in his face"" which has not the unpleasant meaning it bears in English.

[FN#178] Arab. ""Abu riy√°h""=a kind of child's toy. It is our ""bull-roarer"" well known in Australia and parts of Africa.

[FN#179] The people of the region south of the Caspian which is called ""Sea of Daylam."" It has a long history; for which see D'Herbelot, s.v. ""Dilem.""

[FN#180] Coptic convents in Egypt still affect these drawbridges over the keep-moat.

[FN#181] Koran iv., xxii. etc., meaning it is lawful to marry women taken in war after the necessary purification although their husbands be still living. This is not permitted with a free woman who is a True Believer. I have noted that the only concubine slave-girl mentioned in the Koran are these ""captives possessed by the right hand.""

[FN#182] The Amazonian dame is a favourite in folk-lore and is an ornament to poetry from the Iliad to our modern day. Such heroines, apparently unknown to the Pagan Arabs, were common in the early ages of Al-Islam as Ockley and Gibbon prove, and that the race is not extinct may be seen in my Pilgrimage (iii. 55) where the sister of Ibn Rumi resolved to take blood revenge for her brother.

[FN#183] And Solomon said, ""O nobles, which of you will bring me her throne ?"" A terrible genius (i.e. an If rit of the Jinn named Dhakwan or the notorious Sakhr) said, "" I will bring it unto thee before thou arise from thy seat (of justice); for I am able to perform it, and may be trusted"" (Koran, xxvii. 38-39). Balk√≠s or Bilk√≠s (says the Durrat al-Ghaww√°s) daughter of Hoz√°d bin Sharhab√≠l, twenty-second in the list of the rulers of Al- Yaman, according to some murdered her husband, and became, by Moslem ignorance, the Biblical "" Queen of Sheba."" The Abyssinians transfer her from Arabian Saba to Ethiopia and make her the mother by Solomon of Menelek, their proto-monarch; thus claiming for their royalties an antiquity compared with which all reigning houses in the world are of yesterday. The dates of the Tab√°bi'ah or Tobbas prove that the Bilkis of history ruled Al-Yaman in the early Christian era.

[FN#184] Arab. ""Fass,"" fiss or fuss; the gem set in a ring; also applied to a hillock rounded en cabochon. In The Nights it is used to signify ""a fine gem.""

[FN#185] This prominence of the glut√¶i muscles is always insisted upon, because it is supposed to promise well in a bed-fellow. In Somali land where the people are sub- steatopygous, a rich young man, who can afford such luxury, will have the girls drawn up in line and choose her to wife who projects furthest behind

[FN#186] The ""bull"" is only half mine.

[FN#187] A favourite Arab phrase, the ""hot eye"" is one full of tears.

[FN#188] i.e., ""Coral,"" coral branch, a favourite name for a slave-girl, especially a negress. It is the older ""Morgiana."" I do not see why Preston in Al-Har√≠ni's ""Makamah (S√©ance) of Singar"" renders it pearls, because Golius gives ""small pearls,"" when it is evidently ""coral."" Richardson (Dissert. xlviii.) seems to me justified in finding the Pari (fairy) Marjan of heroic Persian history reflected in the Fairy Morgain who earned off King Arthur after the battle of Camelon.

[FN#189] Arab. ""'Ud Jalaki""=Jalak or Jalik being a poetical and almost obsolete name of Damascus.

[FN#190] The fountain in Paradise whose water shall be drunk with ""pure"" wine mixed and sealed with musk (for clay). It is so called because it comes from the ""Sanam"" (Sanima, to be high) boss or highest ridge of the Moslem Heaven (Koran lv. 78 and lxxxiii. 27). Mr. Rodwell says ""it is conveyed to the highest apartments in the Pavilions of Paradise."" (?)

[FN#191] This ""hysterical"" temperament is not rare even amongst the bravest Arabs.

[FN#192] An idea evidently derived from the √Üolipyla (olla animatoria) the invention of Hero Alexandrinus, which showed that the ancient Egyptians could apply the motive force of steam.

[FN#193] Kuthayyir ibn Abi Jumah, a poet and far-famed R√°w√≠ or Tale-reciter, mentioned by Ibn Khallikan he lived at Al-Medinah and sang the attractions of one Azzah, hence his soubriquet S√°hib (lover of) Azzah. As he died in A. H. 105 (=726), his presence here is a gross anachronism the imaginary Sharrkan flourished before the Caliphate of Abd al-Malik bin Marw√°n A. H. 65-86.

[FN#194] Jam√≠l bin Ma'amar, a poet and lover contemporary with
Al-Kuthayrir.

[FN#195] Arab. ""Tafazzal,"" a word of frequent use in conversation=""favour me,"" etc.

[FN#196] The word has a long history. From the Gr. or is the Lat. stibium; while the Low Latin ""antimonium"" and the Span. Althimod are by metathesis for Al-Ithmid. The dictionaries define the substance as a stone from which antimony is prepared, but the Arabs understand a semi-mythical mineral of yellow colour which enters into the veins of the eyes and gives them Iynx-like vision. The famous Anz nicknamed Zark√° (the blue eyed) of Yam√°mah (Province) used it; and, according to some, invented Kohl. When her (protohistoric) tribe Jadis had destroyed all the rival race of Tasm, except Rib√°h ibn Murrah; the sole survivor fled to the Tobba of Al-Yaman, who sent a host to avenge him. The king commanded his Himyarites to cut tree-boughs and use them as screens (again Birnam wood). Zark√° from her Utum, or peel-tower, saw the army three marches off and cried, ""O folk, either trees or Himyar are coming upon you!"" adding, in Rajaz verse:‚Äî

I swear by Allah that trees creep onward, or that Himyar beareth somewhat which he draweth along!

She then saw a man mending his sandal. But Jadis disbelieved; Cassandra was slain and, when her eyes were cut out the vessels were found full of Ithmid. Hence Al-Mutanabbi sang:

""Sharper-sighted than Zark√° of Jau"" (Yam√°mah).

See C. de Perceval i. 101; Arab. Prov. i. 192; and Chenery p. 381.
(The Assemblies of Al-Hariri; London, Williams and Norgate, 1867).
I have made many enquiries into the true nature of Ithmid and
failed to learn anything: on the Upper Nile the word is=Kohl.

[FN#197] The general colour of chessmen in the East, where the game is played on a cloth more often than a board.

[FN#198] Arab. ""Al-fil,"" the elephant=the French fol or fou and our bishop. I have derived ""elephant"" from P√≠l (old Persian, Sansk. Pilu) and Arab. Fil, with the article Al-Fil, whence the Greek the suffix‚Äîas being devoted to barbarous words as Obod-as (Al Ubayd), Aretas (Al-H√°ris), etc. Mr. Isaac Taylor (The Alphabet i. 169), preserves the old absurdity of ""eleph-ant or ox-like (!) beast of Africa."" Prof. Sayce finds the word al-ab (two distinct characters) in line 3, above the figure of an (Indian) elephant, on the black obelisk of Nimrod Mound, and suggests an Assyrian derivation.

[FN#199] Arab. ""Shaukat"" which may also mean the ""pride"" or ""mainstay"" (of the army).

[FN#200] Lit. ""smote him on the tendons of his neck."" This is the famous shoulder-cut (Tawash shuh) which, with the leg-cut (Kalam), formed, and still forms, the staple of Eastern attack with the sword.

[FN#201] Arab. ""Dir√°s."" Easterns do not thresh with flails. The material is strewed over a round and smoothed floor of dried mud in the open air and threshed by different connivances. In Egypt the favourite is a chair-like machine called ""Norag,"" running on iron plates and drawn by bulls or cows over the corn. Generally, however, Moslems prefer the old classical , the Tribulum of Virgil and Varro, a slipper-shaped sled of wood garnished on the sole with large-headed iron nails, or sharp fragments of flint or basalt. Thus is made the ""Tibn"" or straw, the universal hay of the East, which our machines cannot imitate.

[FN#202] These numbers appear to be grossly exaggerated, but they were possible in the days of sword and armour: at the battle of Saffayn the Caliph Ali is said to have cut down five hundred and twenty-three men in a single night.

[FN#203] Arab. ""Bika'√°"": hence the ""Buka'ah"" or Clesyria.

[FN#204] Richardson in his excellent dictionary (note 103) which modern priggism finds ""unscientific "" wonderfully derives this word from Arab. ""Khatt√°f,"" a snatcher (i.e. of women), a ravisher. It is an evident corruption of ""captivus"" through Italian and French

[FN#205] These periodical and fair-like visitations to convents are still customary; especially amongst the Christians of Damascus.

[FN#206] Camphor being then unknown.

[FN#207] The ""wrecker"" is known all over the world; and not only barbarians hold that ships driven ashore become the property of the shore

[FN#208] Arab. ""Jokh"": it is not a dictionary word, but the only term in popular use for European broadcloth.

[FN#209] The second person plural is used because the writer would involve the subjects of his correspondent in the matter.

[FN#210] This part of the phrase, which may seem unnecessary to the European, is perfectly intelligible to all Orientalists. You may read many an Eastern letter and not understand it. Compare Boccacoo iv. 1.

[FN#211] i.e. he was greatly agitated

[FN#212] In text ""Li-ajal a al-Taudi'a,"" for the purpose of farewelling, a low Egyptianism; emphatically a ""Kal√°m w√°ti."" (Pilgrimage thee iii. 330.)

[FN#213] In the Mac. Edit. Sharrkan speaks, a clerical error.

[FN#214] The Farsakh (Germ. Stunde) a measure of time rather than distance, is an hour's travel or its equivalent, a league, a meile=three English stat. miles. The word is still used in Persia its true home, but not elsewhere. It is very old, having been determined as a lineal measure of distance by Herodotus (ii. 5 and 6 ; v. 53), who computes it at 30 furlongs (=furrow-lengths, 8 to the stat. mile). Strabo (xi.) makes it range from 40 to 60 stades (each=606 feet 9 inches), and even now it varies between 1,500 to 6,000 yards. Captain Francklin (Tour to Persia) estimates it = about four miles. (Pilgrimage ii. 113.)

[FN#215] Arab. ""Ashhab."" Names of colours are few amongst semi civilised peoples, but in Arabia there is a distinct word for every shade of horseflesh.

[FN#216] She had already said to him ""Thou art beaten in everything!""

[FN#217] Showing that she was still a Christian.

[FN#218] This is not Badawi sentiment: the honoratioren amongst wild people would scorn such foul play; but amongst the settled Arabs honour between men and women is unknown and such ""hocussing"" would be held quite fair.

[FN#219] The table of wine, in our day, is mostly a japanned tray with glasses and bottles, saucers of pickles and fruits and, perhaps, a bunch of flowers and aromatic herbs. During the Caliphate the ""wine-service"" was on a larger scale.

[FN#220] Here the ""Bhang"" (almost a generic term applied to hellebore, etc.) may be hyoscyamus or henbane. Yet there are varieties of Cannabis, such as the Dakha of South Africa capable of most violent effect. I found the use of the drug well known to the negroes of the Southern United States and of the Brazil, although few of their owners had ever heard of it.

[FN#221] Amongst Moslems this is a reference to Adam who first ""sinned against himself,' and who therefore is called "" Saf√≠yu'llah,"" the Pure of Allah. (Pilgrimage iii. 333.)

[FN#222] Meaning, an angry, violent man.

[FN#223] Arab. ""Insh√°d,"" which may mean reciting the verse of another or improvising one's own. In Modern Egypt ""Munshid"" is the singer or reciter of poetry at Zikrs (Lane M. E. chaps. xxiv.). Here the verses are quite bad enough to be improvised by the hapless Princess.

[FN#224] The negro skin assumes this dust colour in cold, fear, concupiscence and other mental emotions.

[FN#225] He compares her glance with the blade of a Yamani sword, a lieu commun of Eastern poetry. The weapons are famous in The Nights; but the best sword-cutlery came from Persia as the porcelain from China to Sana'√°. Here, however, is especial allusion as to the sword ""Samsam"" or ""Samsamah."" It belonged to the Himyarite Tobba, Amru bin Ma'ad Kurb, and came into the hands of Harun al-Rashid. When the Emperor of the Greeks sent a present of superior sword-blades to him by way of a brave, the Caliph, in the presence of the Envoys, took ""Samsam"" in hand and cut the others in twain as if they were cabbages without the least prejudice to the edge of ""Samsam.""

[FN#226] This touch of pathos is truly Arab. So in the ""Romance of Dalhamah"" (Lane, M. E. xxiii.) the infant Gundubah sucks the breast of its dead mother and the King exclaims, ""If she had committed this crime she would not be affording the child her milk after she was dead.""

[FN#227] Arab. ""Sadda'l-Akt√°r,"" a term picturesque enough to be preserved in English. ""Sadd,"" I have said, is a wall or dyke, the term applied to the great dam of water- plants which obstructs the navigation of the Upper Nile, the lilies and other growths floating with the current from the (Victoria) Nyanza Lake. I may note that we need no longer derive from India the lotus-llily so extensively used by the Ancient Egyptians and so neglected by the moderns that it has well nigh disappeared. All the Central African basins abound in the Nymph√¶a and thence it found its way down the Nile Valley.

[FN#228] Arab. ""Al Marh√∫mah"": equivalent to our ""late lamented.""

[FN#229] Vulgarly pronounced ""Mahmal,"" and by Egyptians and Turks ""Mehmel."" Lane (M. E. xxiv.) has figured this queenly litter and I have sketched and described it in my Pilgrimage (iii. 12).

[FN#230] For such fits of religious enthusiasm see my Pilgrimage (iii. 254).

[FN#231] ""Ir√°k"" (Mesopotamia) means ""a level country beside the banks of a ever.""

[FN#232] ""Al Kuds,"" or ""Bays al-Mukaddas,"" is still the popular name of Jerusalem, from the Heb. Yerushalaim ha-Kadushah (legend on shekel of Simon Maccabeus).

[FN#233] ""Follow the religion of Abraham"" says the Koran (chaps. iii. 89). Abraham, titled ""Khal√≠lu'llah,"" ranks next in dignity to Mohammed, preceding Isa, I need hardly say that his tomb is not in Jerusalem nor is the tomb itself at Hebron ever visited. Here Moslems (soi disant) are allowed by the jealousies of Europe to close and conceal a place which belongs to the world, especially to Jews and Christians. The tombs, if they exist, lie in a vault or cave under the Mosque.

[FN#234] Ab√°, or Ab√°yah, vulg. Abayah, is a cloak of hair, goat's or camel's; too well known to require description.

[FN#235] Arab. ""Al-Wakk√°d,"" the man who lights and keeps up the bath-fires.

[FN#236] Arab. ""M√° al-Khal√°f"" (or ""Khil√°f"") a sickly perfume but much prized, made from the flowers of the Salix √Ügyptiaca.

[FN#237] Used by way of soap; like glasswort and other plants.

[FN#238] i.e., ""Thou art only just recovered.""

[FN#239] To ""Nakh"" is to gurgle ""Ikh! Ikh!"" till the camel kneels. Hence the space called ""Barr al-Man√°khah"" in Al-Medinah (Pilgrimage i. 222, ii. 91). There is a regular camel vocabulary amongst the Arabs, made up like our ""Gee"" (go ye!), etc. of significant words worn down.

[FN#240] Arab. ""Laza,"" the Second Hell provided for Jews.

[FN#241] The word has been explained (vol. i. 112).[see Volume 1, note 199] It is trivial, not occurring in the Koran which uses ""Arabs of the Desert ;"" ""Arabs who dwell in tents,"" etc. (chaps. ix. and xxxiii.). ""A'ar√°bi"" is the classical word and the origin of ""Arab"" is disputed. According to Pocock (Not√¶ Spec. Hist. Arab.): ""Diverse are the opinions concerning the denomination of the Arabs; but the most certain of all is that which draws it from Arabah, which is part of the region of Tehama (belonging to Al-Medinah Pilgrimage ii. 118), which their father Ismail afterwards inhabited."" Tehamah (sierra caliente) is the maritime region of Al Hijaz, the Moslems Holy Land; and its ""Arabah,"" a very small tract which named a very large tract, must not be confounded, as some have done, with the Wady Arabah, the ancient outlet of the Dead Sea. The derivation of ""Arab"" from ""Ya'arab"" a fancied son of Joktan is mythological. In Heb. Arabia may be called ""Eretz Ereb"" (or ""Arab"")=land of the West; but in Arabic ""Gharb"" (not Ereb) is the Occident and the Arab dates long before the Hebrew.

[FN#242] ""When thine enemy extends his hand to thee, cut it off if thou can, or kiss it,"" wisely said Caliph al-Mansur.

[FN#243] The Tartur was a peculiar turban worn by the Northern Arabs and shown in old prints. In modern Egypt the term is applied to the tall sugar-loaf caps of felt affected mostly by regular Dervishes. Burckhardt (Proverbs 194 and 398) makes it the high cap of felt or fur proper to the irregular cavalry called Dely or Delaty. In Dar For (Darfour) ""Tartur"" is a conical cap adorned with beads and cowries worn by the Manghwah or buffoon who corresponds with the Egyptian ""Khalb√∫s"" or ""Maskharah"" and the Turkish ""Sutari."" For an illustration see Plate iv. fig. 10 of Voyage au Darfour par Mohammed El Tounsy (The Tunisian), Paris, Duprat, 1845.

[FN#244] The term is picturesque and true; we say ""gnaw,"" which is not so good.

[FN#245] Here, meaning an Elder, a Chief, etc.; the word has been almost naturalised in English. I have noted that Abraham was the first ""Shaykh.""

[FN#246] This mention of weighing suggests the dust of Dean Swift and the money of the Gold Coast It was done, I have said, because the gold coin, besides being ""sweated"" was soft and was soon worn down.

[FN#247] Fem. of N√°j√≠ (a deliverer, a saviour)=Salvadora.

[FN#248] This, I have noted, is according to Koranic command (chaps. iv. 88). ""When you are saluted with a salutation, salute the person with a better salutation."" The longer answer to ""Peace be with (or upon) thee! "" is still universally the custom. The ""Salem"" is so differently pronounced by every Eastern nation that the observant traveller will easily make of it a Shibboleth.

[FN#249] The Badawi, who was fool as well as rogue, begins to fear that he has kidnapped a girl of family.

[FN#250] These examinations being very indecent are usually done in strictest privacy. The great point is to make sure of virginity.

[FN#251] This is according to strict Moslem law: the purchaser may not look at the girl's nakedness till she is his, and he ought to manage matters through an old woman.

[FN#252] Lit. wrath; affliction which chokes; in Hindustani it means simply anger.

[FN#253] i.e. Heaven forbid I be touched by a strange man.

[FN#254] Used for fuel and other purposes, such as making ""doss stick.""

[FN#255] Arab ""Yaftah'Allah"" the offer being insufficient. The rascal is greedy as a Badaw and moreover he is a liar, which the Badawi is not.

[FN#256] The third of the four great Moslem schools of Theology, taking its name from the Imam al-Sh√°fi'√≠ (Mohammed ibn Idr√≠s) who died in Egypt A.H. 204, and lies buried near Cairo. (Sale's Prel. Disc. sect. viii.)

[FN#257] The Moslem form of Cabbala, or transcendental philosophy of the Hebrews.

[FN#258] Arab. ""Bakh"" the word used by the Apostle to Ali his son-in-law. It is the Latin ""Euge.""

[FN#259] Readers, who read for amusement, will do well to ""skip"" the fadaises of this highly educated young woman.

[FN#260] There are three Persian Kings of this name (Artaxerxes)
which means ""Flour and milk,"" or ""high lion."" The text alludes to
Ardeshir Babegan, so called because he married the daughter of
Babak the shepherd, founder of the Sassanides in A.D. 202. See
D,Herberot, and the Dabistan.

[FN#261] Alluding to the proverb, ""Folk follow their King's faith,""
""Cujus regio ejus religio"" etc.

[FN#262] Second Abbaside, A.H. 136-158 (=754-775).

[FN#263] The celebrated companion of Mohammed who succeeded Abu Bakr in the Caliphate (A.H. 13-23=634-644). The Sunnis know him as Al-Adil the Just, and the Shiahs detest him for his usurpation, his austerity and harshness. It is said that he laughed once and wept once. The laugh was caused by recollecting how he ate his dough-gods (the idols of the Hanifah tribe) in The Ignorance. The tears were drawn by remembering how he buried alive his baby daughter who, while the grave was being dug, patted away the dust from his hair and beard. Omar was doubtless a great man, but he is one of the most ungenial figures in Moslem history which does not abound in genialities. To me he suggests a Puritan, a Covenanter of the sourest and narrowest type; and I cannot wonder that the Persians abhor him, and abuse him on all occasions.

[FN#264] The austere Caliph Omar whose scourge was more feared than the sword was the - author of the celebrated saying ""Consult them (feminines) and do clear contrary-wise.""

[FN#265] Our ""honour amongst thieves.""

[FN#266] The sixth successor of Mohammed and founder of the Banu Umayyah or Ommiades, called the ""sons of the little mother"" from their eponymus (A.H. 41-60=661-680). For his Badawi wife Maysun, and her abuse of her husband, see Pilgrimage iii. 262.

[FN#267] Shaykh of the noble tribe, or rather nation, Banu Tam√≠m and a notable of the day, surnamed, no one knows why, ""Sire of the Sea.""

[FN#268] This is essential for cleanliness in hot lands: however much the bath may be used, the body-pile and lower hair, if submitted to a microscope, will show more or less sordes adherent. The axilla-hair is plucked because if shaved the growing pile causes itching and the depilatories are held deleterious. At first vellication is painful but the skin becomes used to it. The pecten is shaved either without or after using depilatories, of which more presently. The body-pile is removed by ""Takhf√≠f""; the Lib√°n Sh√°mi (Syrian incense), a fir- gum imported from Scio, is melted and allowed to cool in the form of a pledget. This is passed over the face and all the down adhering to it is pulled up by the roots (Burckhardt No. 420). Not a few Anglo-Indians have adopted these precautions

[FN#269] This Caliph was a tall, fair, handsome man of awe-inspiring aspect. Omar used to look at him and say, ""This is the C√¶sar of the Arabs,"" while his wife called him a ""fatted ass.""

[FN#270] The saying is attributed to Abraham when ""exercised"" by the unkindly temper of Sarah; ""woman is made hard and crooked like a rib;"" and the modern addition is, ""whoso would straighten her, breaketh her.""

[FN#271] i.e. ""When ready and in erection.""

[FN#272] ""And do first (before going in to your wives) some act which may be profitable unto your souls"" or, for you: soul's good. (Koran, chaps. ii. 223.) Hence Ahnaf makes this prayer.

[FN#273] It was popularly said that ""Truth-speaking left Omar without a friend."" Entitled ""The Just"" he was murdered by Abu L√∫l√∫ah, alias F√≠r√∫z, a (Magian ?) slave of Al-Magh√≠rah for denying him justice.

[FN#274] Governor of Bassorah under the first four Caliphs. See
D'Herbelot s.v. ""Asch√°ri.""

[FN#275] Ziyad bin Abi Sufyan, illegitimate brother of the Caliph
Mu'awiyah afterwards governor of Bassorah, Cufa and Al-Hijaz.

[FN#276] The seditions in Kufah were mainly caused by the wilful nepotism of Caliph Othman bin As√°kir which at last brought about his death. His main quality seems to have been personal beauty: ""never was seen man or woman of fairer face than he and he was the most comely of men:"" he was especially famed for beautiful teeth which in old age he bound about with gold wire. He is described as of middling stature, large- limbed, broad shouldered, fleshy of thigh and long in the fore-arm which was hairy. His face inclined to yellow and was pock-marked; his beard was full and his curly hair, which he dyed yellow, fell below his ears. He is called ""writer of the Koran"" from his edition of the M.S., and ""Lord of the two Lights"" because he married two of the Prophet's daughters, Rukayyah and Umm Kulthum; and, according to the Shi'ahs who call him Othman-i-Lang or"" limping Othman,"" he vilely maltreated them. They justify his death as the act of an Ijm√°' al-Muslim√≠n, the general consensus of Moslems which ratifies ""Lynch law."" Altogether Othman is a mean figure in history.

[FN#277] ""N√°r"" (fire) is a word to be used delicately from its connection with Gehenna. You say, e.g. ""bring me a light, a coal (bassah)"" etc.; but if you say ""bring me fire! "" the enemy will probably remark ""He wanteth fire even before his time!"" The slang expression would be ""bring the sweet."" (Pilgrimage i. 121.)

[FN#278] Omar is described as a man of fair complexion, and very ruddy, but he waxed tawny with age, when he also became bald and grey. He had little hair on the cheeks but a long mustachio with reddish ends. In stature he overtopped the people and was stout as he was tall. A popular saying of Mohammed's is, ""All (very) long men are fools save Omar, and all (very) short men are knaves save Ali."" The Persians, who abhor Omar, compare every lengthy, ungainly, longsome thing with him; they will say, ""This road never ends, like the entrails of Omar."" We know little about Ali's appearance except that he was very short and stout, broad and full-bellied with a tawny complexion and exceedingly hairy, his long beard, white as cotton, filling all the space between his shoulders. He was a ""pocket. Hercules,"" and incredible tales, like that about the gates of Khaybar, are told of his strength. Lastly, he was the only Caliph who bequeathed anything to literature: his ""Cantiloquium"" is famous and he has left more than one mystical and prophetic work. See Ockley for his ""Sentences"" and D'Herbelot s. D. ""Ali"" and ""Gebr."" Ali is a noble figure in Moslem history.

[FN#279] The emancipation from the consequences of his sins; or it may mean a holy death.

[FN#280] Battle fought near Al-Medinah A.D. 625. The word is derived from ""shad"" (one). I have described the site in my Pilgrimage, (vol. ii. 227).

[FN#281] ""Haphsa"" in older writers; Omar's daughter and one of Mohammed's wives, famous for her connection with the manuscripts of the Koran. From her were (or claimed to be) descended the Hafsites who reigned in Tunis and extended their power far and wide over the Maghrib (Mauritania), till dispossessed by the Turks.

[FN#282] i.e. humbly without the usual strut or swim: it corresponds with the biblical walking or going softly. (I Kings xxi. 27; Isaiah xxxviii. 15, etc.)

[FN#283] A theologian of the seventh and eighth centuries.

[FN#284] i.e. to prepare himself by good works, especially alms-giving, for the next world.

[FN#285] A theologian of the eighth century.

[FN#286] Abd al-Aziz was eighth Ommiade (regn. A.H. 99=717) and the fifth of the orthodox, famed for a piety little known to his house. His most celebrated saying was, "" Be constant in meditation on death: if thou bein straitened case 'twill enlarge it, and if in affluence 'twill straiten it upon thee."" He died. poisoned, it is said, in A.H 101,

[FN#287] Abu Bakr originally called Abd al-Ka'abah (slave of the Ka'abah) took the name of Abdullah and was surnamed Abu Bakr (father of the virgin) when Mohammed, who before had married only widows, took to wife his daughter, the famous or infamous Ayishah. ""Bikr"" is the usual form, but ""Bakr,"" primarily meaning a young camel, is metaphorically applied to human youth (Lane's Lex. s. c.). The first Caliph was a cloth-merchant, like many of the Meccan chiefs. He is described as very fair with bulging brow, deep set eyes and thin-checked, of slender build and lean loined, stooping and with the backs of his hands fleshless. He used tinctures of Henna and Katam for his beard. The Persians who hate him, call him ""Pir-i-Kaft√°r,"" the old she-hyaena, and believe that he wanders about the deserts of Arabia in perpetual rut which the males must satisfy.

[FN#288] The second, fifth, sixth and seventh Ommiades.

[FN#289] The mother of Omar bin Abd al-Aziz was a granddaughter of
Omar bin al-Khattab.

[FN#290] Brother of this Omar's successor, Yezid II.

[FN#291] So the Turkish proverb ""The fish begins to stink at the head.""

[FN#292] Calling to the slaves.

[FN#293] When the ""Day of Arafat"" (9th of Z√∫'l-Hijjah) falls upon a Friday. For this Hajj al- Akbar see my Pilgrimage iii. 226. It is often confounded by writers (even by the learned M. Caussin de Perceval) with the common Pilgrimage as opposed to the Umrah, or "" Lesser Pilgrimage"" (ibid. iii. 342, etc.). The latter means etymologically cohabiting with a woman in her father's house as opposed to 'Ars or leading her to the husband's home: it is applied to visiting Meccah and going through all the pilgrim-rites but not at the Pilgrimage-season. Hence its title ""Hajj al-Asghar"" the ""Lesser Hajj."" But ""Umrah"" is also applied to a certain ceremony between the hills Saf√° (a large hard rock) and Marwah (stone full of flints), which accompanies the Hajj and which I have described (ibid. iii. 344). At Meccah I also heard of two places called Al-Umrah, the Greater in the Wady F√°timah and the Lesser half way nearer the city (ibid. iii. 344).

[FN#294] A fair specimen of the unworthy egoism which all religious systems virtually inculcate Here a pious father leaves his children miserable to save his own dirty soul.

[FN#295] Chief of the Ban√∫ Tam√≠n, one of the noblest of tribes, derived from Tam√≠m, the uncle of Kuraysh (Koreish); hence the poets sang:‚Äî

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     There cannot be a son nobler than Kuraysh,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†     Nor an uncle nobler than Tam√≠m.

The high minded Tam√≠n is contrasted with the mean-spirited Kays, who also gave rise to a tribe; and hence the saying concerning one absolutely inconsistent, ""Art thou now Tam√≠n and then Kays?""

[FN#296] Surnamed Al-Sakafi, Governor of Al-Yaman and Irak.

[FN#297] Tenth Ommiade (regn. A H. 105-125 = 724-743).

[FN#298] Or ""clothe thee in worn-out clothes"" i.e. ""Become a Fakir"" or religious mendicant.

[FN#299] This gratuitous incest in ignorance injures the tale and is as repugnant to Moslem as to Christian taste.

[FN#300] The child is named either on the day of its birth or on that day week. The father whispers it in the right ear, often adding the Az√°n or prayer-call, and repeating in the left ear the ""Ik√°mah"" or Friday sentence. There are many rules for choosing names according to the week-day, the ascendant planet, the ""Sortes Coranic√¶,"" etc.

[FN#301] Amongst Moslems as amongst Christians there are seven deadly sins: idolatry, murder, falsely charging modest women with unchastity, robbing orphans, usury, desertion in Holy War and disobedience to parents. The difference between the two creeds is noteworthy. And the sage knows only three, intemperance, ignorance and egoism.

[FN#302] Meaning, ""It was decreed by Destiny; so it came to pass,"" appropriate if not neat.

[FN#303] The short, stout, dark, long-haired and two-bunched camel from ""Bukhtar"" (Bactria), the ""Eastern"" (Bakhtar) region on the Amu or Jayhun (Oxus) River; afterwards called Khorasan. The two-humped camel is never seen in Arabia except with northern caravans, and to speak of it would be a sore test of Badawi credulity.

[FN#304] ""Kayl√∫lah"" is the ""forty-winks"" about noon: it is a Sunnat or Practice of the Prophet who said, ""Make the mid-day siesta, for verily at this hour the devils sleep not."" ""Ayl√∫lain"" is slumbering after morning prayers (our ""beauty-sleep""), causing heaviness andid leness: ""Ghayl√∫lah"" is dozing about 9 a.m. engendering poverty and wretchedness: ""Kayl√∫lah"" (with the guttural Kaf) is sleeping before evening prayers and ""Fayl√∫lah"" is slumbering after sunset‚Äîboth held to be highly detrimental. (Pilgrimage ii 49.)

[FN#305] The Biblical ""Hamath"" (Hightown) too well known to require description. It is still famous for the water-wheels mentioned by al-Hariri (assembly of the Banu Har√°m).

[FN#306] When they say, ""The levee flashes bright on the hills of
Al-Yaman,"" the allusion is to the south quarter, where
summer-lightning is seen. Al-Yaman (always with the article) means,
I have said, the right-hand region to one facing the rising sun and
Al-Sham (Syria) the left-hand region.
[FN#307] Again ""he"" for ""she,"" in delicacy and jealousy of making public the beauty or conditions of the ""veiled sex."" Even public singers would hesitate to use a feminine pronoun. As will be seen however, the rule is not invariably kept and hardly ever in Badawi poetry.

[FN#308] The normal pun on ""Nuzhat al-Zaman"" = Delight of the Age or Time.

[FN#309] The reader will find in my Pilgrimage (i. 305) a sketch of the Takht-rawan or travelling-litter, in which pilgrimesses are wont to sleep.

[FN#310] In poetry it holds the place of our Zephyr; end the ""B√°d- i-Sab√°""=Breeze o' the morn, Is much addressed by Persian poets.

[FN#311] Here appears the nervous, excitable, hysterical Arab temperament which is almost phrensied by the neighbourhood of a home from which he had run away.

[FN#312] Zau al-Makan and Nuzhat al-Zaman.

[FN#313] The idea is essentially Eastern, ""A lion at home and a lamb abroad"" is the popular saying.

[FN#314] Arab. ""Hubb al-Watan"" (= love of birthplace, patriotism) of which the Tradition says ""Min al-Im√°n"" (=is part of man's religion).

[FN#315] He is supposed to speak en prince; and he yields to a prayer when he spurns a command.

[FN#316] In such caravans each party must keep its own place under pain of getting into trouble with the watchmen and guards.

[FN#317] Mr. Payne (ii. 109) borrows this and the next quotation from the Bull Edit. i. 386.

[FN#318] For the expiation of inconsiderate oaths see Koran (chaps. v.). I cannot but think that Al-Islam treats perjury too lightly: all we can say is-that it improves upon Hinduism which practically seems to leave the punishment to the gods.

[FN#319] ""Kausar,"" as has been said, represents the classical nectar, the Amrita of the Hindus.

[FN#320] From Bull Edit. i. 186. The couplet in the Mac. Edit. i. 457 is very wildly applied.

[FN#321] The ""insula"" of Sancho Panza.

[FN#322] This should have assured him that he stood in no danger.

[FN#323] Here ends the wearisome tale of the brother and sister, and the romance of chivalry begins once more with the usual Arab digressions.

[FN#324] I have derived this word from the Persian ""rang""=colour, hue, kind.

[FN#325] Otherwise all would be superseded, like U. S. officials under a new President.

[FN#326] Arab. ""N√≠mshah"" from the Pers. N√≠mchah, a ""half-sword,"" a long dagger worn in the belt. Richardson derives it from Namsh, being freckled (damasked).

[FN#327] The Indian term for a tent large enough to cover a troop of cavalry.

[FN#328] Arab. ""Marh√∫m"" a formula before noticed. It is borrowed from the Jewish, ""of blessed memory"" (after the name of the honoured dead, Prov. x. 17.); with the addition of ""upon whom be peace,"" as opposed to the imprecation, ""May the name of the wicked rot!""

[FN#329] The speeches of the five damsels should be read only by students.

[FN#330] i.e. Those who look for ""another and a better.""

[FN#331] The title of Caliph Abu Bakr because he bore truthful witness to the Apostle's mission or, others say, he confirmed the ""Mi'r√°j"" or nocturnal journey to Heaven.

[FN#332] All this is Koranic (chaps. ii., etc.).

[FN#333] This may have applied more than once to ""hanging judges"" in the Far West.

[FN#334] A traditionist and jurisconsult of Al-Medinah in the seventh and eighth centuries.

[FN#335] The Alexander of the Koran and Eastern legends, not to be confounded with the Alexander of Macedon. He will be noticed in a future Night.

[FN#336] √Üsop, according to the Arabs: of him or rather of the two
Lukmans, more presently.

[FN#337] Koran ii. 185.

[FN#338] Mohammed.

[FN#339] One of the Ash√°b or Companions of Mohammed.

[FN#340] A noted traditionist at Cufa in the seventh century.

[FN#341] Koran, chaps. lxxiv. I (and verse 8 follows). The Archangel Gabriel is supposed to address Mohammed and not a few divines believe this Surah (chapter) to have been first revealed. Mr. Rodwell makes it No. ii. following the Fatrah or silent interval which succeeded No. xcvi. ""Clots of Blood."" See his 2nd Edit. p. 3 for further details.

[FN#342] i.e. dangerous to soul-health.

[FN#343] In the Mac. Edit. ""Abd"" for ""Sa'id."" The latter was a black and a native of Cufa during the first century (A.H ) and is still famous as a traditionist.

[FN#344] Arab. ""Shirk,"" giving a partner to Allah, attending chiefly to Christians and idolaters and in a minor degree to Jews and Guebres. We usually English it by ""polytheism,"" which is clumsy and conveys a wrong idea

[FN#345] Grandson of the Caliph Ali. He is one of the Imams
(High-priests) of the Shi'ah school.

[FN#346] An eminent traditionist of the eighth century (A.D.).

[FN#347] The prayers of the Fast-month and Pilgrimage-month are often said in especial places outside the towns and cities; these are the Indian Id(Eed-)g√°h. They have a screen of wall about a hundred yards long with a central prayer-niche and the normal three steps for the preacher; and each extremity is garnished with an imitation minaret. They are also called Nam√°z-gah and one is sketched by Herklots (Plate iii. fig. 2). The object of the trips thither in Zu'l-Ka'adah and Zu'l-Hijjah is to remind Moslems of the ""Ta'ar√≠f,"" or going forth from Meccah to Mount Arafat.

[FN#348] Arab. ""Al-H√°fi,"" which in Egyptian means sore-footed as well. He was an ascetic of the eighth and ninth centuries (A.D.). He relates a tradition of the famous soldier saint Kh√°lid bin Wal√≠d who lies buried like the poet Ka'ab al-Ahb√°r near Hums (Emessa) once the Botia, Phrygia, Abdera, Suabia of Syria now Halbun (pronounced Halb√°un) near Damascus. I cannot explain how this Kuraysh noble (a glorious figure in Moslem history) is claimed by the Afghans as one of their countrymen and made to speak Pukhtu or Pushtu, their rough old dialect of Persian. The curious reader will consult my Pilgrimage iii. 322 for the dialogue between Mohammed and Khalid. Again there is general belief in Arabia that the English sent a mission to the Prophet, praying that Khalid might be despatched to proselytise them: unfortunately Mohammed was dead and the ""Ingr√≠z"" ratted. It is popularly held that no armed man can approach Khalid's grave; but I suppose my revolver did not count.

[FN#349] When he must again wash before continuing prayer.

[FN#350] Bin Adham; another noted ascetic of the eighth century.
Those curious about these unimportant names will consult the great
Biographical Dictionary of Ibn Khallikan, translated by Baron
MacGuckin de Slane (1842-45).

[FN#351] Thus making Bishr the ""Im√°m"" (artistes) lit. one who stands in front. In Koran xvii. 74 it means ""leader"": in ii. 118 Allah makes Abraham an ""Imam to mankind.""

[FN#352] A favourite sentiment in the East: we find it at the very beginning of Sa'di's Gulistan: better a weal-bringing lie than a harm-dealing truth.

[FN#353] A penny, one sixth of the drachma.

[FN#354] Founder of the Hanbali, fourth (in date) of the four orthodox Moslem schools. The Caliph al-Mu'atasim bi'llah, son of Harun al-Rashid, who believed the Koran to have been created and not a Logos (whatever that may be), co-eternal with Allah, scourged this Imam severely for ""differing in opinion"" (A.H. 220=833). In fact few of the notable reverends of that day escaped without a caress of the scourge or the sword.

[FN#355] A learned man of the eighth century at Bassorah (A.D.).

[FN#356] A traditionist of Khorasan in the ninth century (A.D.).

[FN#357] ""Azal,"" opp. to ""Abad,"" eternity without end, infinity.

[FN#358] Koran lxvi. 6.

[FN#359] A traditionist of Al-Medinah, eighth century (A.D.).

[FN#360] Arab. ""M√∫s√°"": the Egyptian word was ""Mesu,"" the ""child"" or the ""boy"" (brought up in the palace?), and the Hebrews made it ""Mosheh"" or ""one drawn out of the water;"" ""Mu"" in Egypt being water, the Arab ""Ma""; whence probably the moderns have derived the dim. ""Moyeh ,"" vulg. Egyptian for water.

[FN#361] Koran, chaps. xxviii.: Shu'ayb is our Jethro: Koran, chaps. vii. and xi. Mr. Rodwell suggests (p. 101) that the name has been altered from Hobab (Numb. x. 29).

[FN#362] Arab. ""Taub"" (Saub), the long shirt popularly written in English Tobe and pronounced so by Egyptians. It is worn by both sexes (Lane, M. E. chaps. i. ""Tob"") in Egypt, and extends into the heart of Moslem Africa: I can compare it with nothing but a long nightgown dyed a dirty yellow by safflower and about as picturesque as a carter's smock-frock.

[FN#363] There is nothing of this in the Koran; and it is a most unhappy addition, as Moses utterly and pretentiously ignored a ""next world.""

[FN#364] Koran xxviii. 22-27. Mohammed evidently confounded the contract between Laban and Jacob. (Gen. xxix. 15-39.)

[FN#365] So says Al-Hariri (Ass. of Sasan), ""The neighbour before the house and the traveller before the journey."" In certain cities the neighbourhood is the real detective police, noting every action and abating scandals (such as orgies, etc.) with a strong hand and with the full consent of public opinion and of the authorities. This loving the neighbour shows evident signs of being borrowed from Christianity.

[FN#366] Al-Asamm a theologian of Balkh, ninth century (A.D.).

[FN#367] The founder of the Senior School, for which see Sale Prel.
Disc. sect. viii.

[FN#368] Thus serving the Lord by sinning against his own body.

[FN#369] An Egyptian doctor of the law (ninth century).

[FN#370] Koran lxxvii. 35, 36. This is one of the earliest and most poetical chapters of the book.

[FN#371] Abu Hanifah was scourged for refusing to take office and was put to death in prison, it is said by poison (A.H. 150=A.D. 767), for a judicial sentence authorising rebellion against the second Abbaside, Al-Mansur, surnamed Abu'l-Daw√°nik (Father of Pence) for his exceeding avarice.

[FN#372] ""L√° rayba f√≠-hi"" says the Koran (ii. 1) of itself; and the saying is popularly applied to all things of the Faith.

[FN#373] Arab. ""Riv√°l al-Ghayb,"" somewhat like the ""Himalayan Brothers"" of modern superstition. See Herklots (Qanoon-e-Islam) for a long and careful description of these ""Mard√°n-i-Ghayb"" (Pers.), a ""class of people mounted on clouds,"" invisible, but moving in a circular orbit round the world, and suggesting the Hindu ""Lokap√°las."" They should not be in front of the traveller nor on his right, but either behind or on his left hand. Hence tables, memorial couplets and hemistichs are required to ascertain the station, without which precaution journeys are apt to end badly.

[FN#374] A sweetmeat before noticed.

[FN#375] Door hinges in the east are two projections for the top and bottom of the leaf playing in hollows of the lintel and threshold. It appears to be the primitive form, for we find it in the very heart of Africa. In the basaltic cities of the Hauran, where the doors are of thick stone, they move easily on these pins. I found them also in the official (not the temple)City of Palmyra, but all broken.

[FN#376] The effect of the poison and of the incantation which accompanied it.

[FN#377] King Omar who had raped her. My sympathies are all with the old woman who nightly punished the royal lecher.

[FN#378] Arab. ""Zunn√°r,"" the Gr. . Christians and Jews were compelled by the fanatical sumptuary laws of the Caliph Al- Mutawakkil (AD. 856) to wear a broad leather belt in public, hence it became a badge of the Faith. Probably it was confounded with the ""Janeo"" (Brahmanical thread) and the Parsi sacred girdle called Kashti. (Dabistan i, 297, etc.). Both Mandeville and La Brocqui√®re speak of ""Christians of the Girdle, because they are all girt above,"" intending Jacobites or Nestorians.

[FN#379] ""Sil√°h d√°r"" (Arab. and Pers.)=a military officer of high rank; literally an ""armour-bearer,"" chosen for velour and trustworthiness. So Jonathan had a ""young man"" (brave) who bare his armour (I Sam. xiv. 1, 6 and 7); and Goliath had a man that bare the shield before him (ibid. xvii. 7, 41). Men will not readily forget the name of Sulayman Agha, called the Silahdar, in Egypt. (Lane M. E. chaps. iv.)

[FN#380] It will be told afterwards.

[FN#381] The elder brother thus showed himself a vassal and proved himself a good Moslem by not having recourse to civil war.

[FN#382] Arab. ""Ghazwah,"" the corrupt Gallicism, now
Europeanised=raid, foray.
[FN#383] Turk in modern parlance means a Turkoman, a pomade: the settled people call themselves Osmanli or Othmanli. Turkoman=Turk- like.

[FN#384] Arab. ""Nims√°;"" southern Germans, Austrians; from the Slav. ""Nemica"" (any Germans), literally meaning ""The dumb"" (nemac), because they cannot speak Slav.

[FN#385] Arab. ""Dub√°r√°"" from the Slav. ""Dubrovnik,"" from ""Dub"" (an oak) and ""Dubrava"" (an oak forest). Ragusa, once a rival of Venice, gave rise to the word ""Argosy."" D'Herbelot calls it ""Dobravenedik"" or ""Good Venice,"" the Turkish name, because it paid tribute when Venice would not (?).

[FN#386] Arab. ""Jawarnah,"" or, ""J√∫rnah"" evidently Zara, a place of many names, Jadera (Hirtius de Bell. Alex. cap. 13), Jadra, Zadra (whence the modern term), Diadora, Diadosca and Jadrossa. This important Liburnian city sent forth many cruisers in crusading days; hence the Arabs came to know its name.

[FN#387] Arab. ""Banu'l-Asfar;"" which may mean ""Pale faces,"" in the sense of ""yeller girls"" (New Orleans) and that intended by North American Indians, or, possibly, the peoples with yellow (or rather tow-coloured) hair we now call Russians. The races of Hindostan term the English not ""white men,"" but ""red men;"" and the reason will at once be seen by comparing a Britisher with a high-caste N√°gar Brahman whose face is of parchment colour as if he had drunk exsangue cuminum. The Yellow-faces of the text correspond with the Sansk. ""Svetadvipa""‚ÄîWhiteman's Land.

[FN#388] Arab. ""Al-Musakhkham."" No Moslem believes that Isa was crucified and a favourite fancy is that Judas, changed to the likeness of Jesus, thus paid for his treason. (Evangel. Barnab√¶.) Hence the resurrection is called not ""Kiy√°mah"" but ""Kum√°mah""=rubbish. This heresy about the Cross they share with the Docetes, ""certain beasts in the shape of men"" (says Ignatius), who held that a phantom was crucified. So far the Moslems are logical, for ""Isa,"" being angelically, miraculously and immaculately conceived, could not be; but they contradict themselves when they hold a vacant place near Mohammed's tomb for the body of Isa after his second coming as a forerunner to Mohammed and Doomday. (Pilgrimage ii. 89.)

[FN#389] A diviner, priest, esp. Jewish, and not belonging to the tribe of Levi.

[FN#390] Again the coarsest word ""Khara."" The allusion is to the
vulgar saying, ""Thou eatest skite!"" (i.e. thou talkest nonsense).
Decent English writers modify this to, ""Thou eatest dirt:"" and Lord
Beaconsfield made it ridiculous by turning it into ""eating sand.""
[FN#391] These silly scandals, which cause us only to smile, excite
Easterns to fury. I have seen a Moslem wild with rage on hearing a
Christian parody the opening words of the Koran, ""Bismillahi 'l-
Rahm√°ni 'l-Rah√≠m, Mismish wa Kamar al-din,"" roughly translated,

""In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate! Apricots and marmalede."" The idea of the Holy Merde might have been suggested by the Hindus: see Mandeville, of the archiprotopapaton (prelate) carrying ox-dung and urine to the King, who therewith anoints his brow and breast, &c. And, incredible to relate, this is still practiced after a fashion by the Parsis, one of the most progressive and the sharpest witted of Asiatic races.

[FN#392] Meaning that he had marked his brow with a cross (of ashes?) as certain do on Ash Wednesday.

[FN#393] Syria, the ""left-hand land"" as has before been explained. The popular saying about its people is ""Sh√°mi sh√∫mi!""‚Äîthe Syrian is small potatoes (to render the sense Americanic√®). Nor did Syrus, the slave in Roman days, bear the best of names. In Al-Hijaz the Syrian is addressed ""Ab√∫ Sh√°m"" (Father of Syria) and insulted as ""Abuser of the Salt"" (a traitor). Yet many sayings of Mohammed are recorded in honour of Syria, and he sometimes used Syriac words. Such were ""Bakh, bakh"" (=euge, before noticed), and ""Kakh,"" a congener of the Latin Cacus and Caca which our day has docked to ""cack."" (Pilgrimage iii. 115)

[FN#394] Koran xiv. 34. ""They (Unbelievers) shall be thrown therein (i.e., the House of Perdition=Hell); and an unhappy dwelling shall it be.""

[FN#395] The leg-cut is a prime favourite with the Eastern Sworder, and a heavy two-handed blade easily severs a horse's leg.

[FN#396] Mohammed repeatedly declared (Koran lxi.) that the Christians had falsified the passage (""I go to my Father and the Paraclete shall come,"" John xvi. 7) promising the advent of the Comforter, (ibid. xiv. 20; xv. 26) by substituting the latter word for glorious, renowned, i.e., Ahmed or Mohammed=the praised one. This may have been found in the Arabic translation of the Gospels made by Warakah, cousin to Mohammed's first wife; and hence in Koran lxi. we find Jesus prophesying of an Apostle ""whose name shall be Ahmad."" The word has consequently been inserted into the Arabic Gospel of Saint Barnabas (Dabistan iii. 67). Moslems accept the Pentateuch, the Psalter and the Gospel; but assert (Koran, passim.) that all extant copies have been hopelessly corrupted, and they are right. Moses, to whom the Pentateuch is attributed, notices his own death and burial‚Äî""the mair the miracle,"" said the old Scotch lady. The ""Psalms of David"" range over a period of some five hundred years, and there are three Isaiahs who pass with the vulgar for one. The many apocryphal Gospels, all of which have been held genuine and canonical at different times and in different places, prove that the four, which are still in use, were retained because they lack the manifest absurdities of their discarded rivals.

[FN#397] Arab. "" Labbayka; "" the Pilgrimage-cry (Night xxii.) which in Arabic is,

Labbayk' Allahumma, Labbayk'!
L√° Shar√≠ka lake, Labbayk'!
Inna 'l-hamda w'al ni'amata lake wa'l mulk!
Labbayk' Allahumma, Labbayk'!

Some add ""Here am I, and I honour Thee, the son of Thy two slaves; beneficence and good are all between Thy hands.""With the ""Talbiyah"" the pilgrims should bless the Prophet, pray Allah to grant Heaven and exclaim, ""By Thy mercy spare us from the pains of Hell-fire!"" (Pilgrimage iii. 232.) Labbayka occurs in the verses attributed to Caliph Ali; so labba=he faced, and yalubbu=it faces (as one house faces another); lastly, he professed submission to Allah; in which sense, together with the verbal noun ""Talbiyah,"" it is used by Al- Hanri (Pref. and Ass. of Su'adah).

[FN#398] Arab. ""Kiss√≠s"" (plur. Kus√∫s) from .

[FN#399] Koran ii. The ""red cow"" is evidently the ""red heifer"" of
Barnabas, chaps. vii.

[FN#400] Arab. ""Al-J√°sal√≠k""= .

[FN#401] This is from the first ""Gospel of Infancy,"" wherein Jesus said to his mother, ""Verily I am Jesus, the Son of God, the Word which thou hast brought forth, as the Angel Gabriel did declare unto thee; and my Father hath sent me to save the world"" (chaps. i. 2.). The passage is virtually quoted in the Koran (chaps. iii. 141), of course omitting "" the Son of God""

[FN#402] Mohammed allowed his locks to grow down to his ear-lobes but never lower.

[FN#403] Arab. ""Lis√°m"" I have explained as a covering for the lower face, made by drawing over it the corner of the head-kerchief (Pilgrimage i. 346). The Lis√°m of the African Taw√°rik hoods the eyes so that a man must turn up his face to see, and swathes all the lower half, leaving only the nose exposed. And this is worn by many men by night as well as by day, doubtless to avoid the evil eye. The native Sultans of Darfur, like those of Bornu and others further west, used white muslin as a face-wrap: hence, too, the ceremonies when spitting, etc., etc. The K√∫fiyah or head-kerchief of the Arabs soon reached Europe and became in Low Latin Cuphia; in Spanish Escofia; in Ital. Cuffia or Scuffia; in French Escoffion, Scofion (Reine Marguerite) Co√´ffe (une pellicule, marque de bonheur) Coiffe and Coife, &c.; the Scotch Curch or Coif, opposed to the maiden snood, and, lastly our Sergeant-at-Law's Coif. Littr√©, the Learned, who in erudition was n√© coiff√©, has missed this obvious derivation.

[FN#404] ""Cutting,"" throughout the book, alludes to the scymitar with which Arabs never give point; and ""thrusting"" to the footman's spear and the horseman's lance.

[FN#405] A popular phrase, I repeat, for extreme tenor and consternation.

[FN#406] The name usually applies to a well-known district and city of Al Yaman, where ""Koss the eloquent"" was bishop in Mohammed's day: the Negiran of D'Herbelot. Here, however, it is the Syrian Najr√°n (Nejr√¢n of Missionary Porter's miserable Handbook), now a wretched village near the volcanic Lajj√°, about one hundred and twenty miles direct south of Damascus and held by Druzes and Christians.

[FN#407] The Kant√°r (quintal) of 100 ratls (Ibs.) =98-99 Ibs. avoir.

[FN#408] Arab. ""Jur√°b (bag) mi'adat- ih (of his belly),"" the ""curdling of the testicles"" in fear is often mentioned.

[FN#409] Clearly alluding to the magic so deeply studied by medi√¶val Jews.

[FN#410] Arab. ""Sah√°kah,"" lit. rubbing. The Moslem Harem is a great school for this ""Lesbian (which I would call Atossan) love ""; but the motive of the practice lies deeper. As amongst men the mixture of the feminine with the masculine temperament leads to sodomy, so the reverse makes women prefer their own sex. These tribades are mostly known by peculiarities of form and features, hairy cheeks and upper lips, gruff voices, hircine odour and the large projecting clitoris with erectile powers known to the Arabs as ""bazar"" hence Tabz√≠r=circumcision or amputation of such clitoris. Burckhardt (Prov. 436) translates "" Bazarah"" by slut or wench. He adds "" it originally signifies the labia which the Cairenes also entice Zamb√∫r and which are cut off in girlhood."" See also Lane, Lex. s.v.; Tabz√≠r. Both writers confuse excision of the nymph√¶ with circumcision of the clitoris (Zamb√∫r) Al-Siy√∫ti (Kitab al-Iz√°' fi'Ilm al-Nikah) has a very interesting chapter on Sapphic venery, which is well known to Europe as proved by such works as ""Gamiani,"" and ""Anandria ou Confessions de Mademoiselle Sappho, avec la Clef,"" Lesbos, 1718. Onanism is fatally prevalent: in many Harems and girls' schools tallow candles and similar succedanea are vainly forbidden and bananas when detected are cut into four so as to be useless; of late years, however, China has sent some marvellous artificial phalli of stuffed bladder, horn and even caoutchouc, the latter material of course borrowed from Europe.

[FN#411] This is considered a powerful aphrodisiac in the East. Hence male devotees are advised to avoid tile ""two reds,"" i.e. meat and wine; while the ""two reds,"" which corrupt women, are gold and saffron, that is perfumery. Hence also the saying of Mohammed:‚Äî ""Perfumes for men should have scent and not colour; for women should have colour and not scent."" (Mishk√°t al-Mas√°b√≠h ii. 361.)


[FN#412] These are the ""Hib√°s"" or thin cords of wool which the
Badawi binds round his legs, I believe to keep off cramp.
(Pilgrimage iii. 78).

[FN#413] Crying out ""La il√°ha illa 'llah."" (There is no god but the
God.); technically called ""Tahl√≠l.""

[FN#414] i.e. Men, angels and devils, the ""Triloka"" (triple people) of the Hindus. Alam√≠n (plur.), never Alamayn (dual), is the Triregno denoted by the papal Tiara, the three Christian kingdoms being Heaven, Hell and Purgatory.

[FN#415] Matrahinna or Mit-Rahinah is a well-known village near Memphis, the name being derived from the old Egyptian Minat-ro- hinnu, the port at the mouth of the canal. Let me remark that two of these three words, ""Minat"" and ""Ru,"" are still common in "" Aryan"" Persian.

[FN#416] Kir√°mat, a sign, a prodigy, opposed to Mu'ujizah, a miracle wrought by a prophet. The Sufis explain this thaumaturgy by Allah changing something of Nature's ordinary course in favour of an especial worshipper, and, after a fashion, this is Catholic doctrine (See Dabistan, iii. 173).

[FN#417] Koran, x. 25, ""until the earth receive its vesture and be adorned with various plants.""

[FN#418] i.e. the young hair sprouting on the boy's cheek.

[FN#419] A fighter for the faith and now a title which follows the name, e.g. Osm√°n P√°sh√° Gh√°z√≠, whom the English press dubbed ""Ghazi Osman.""

[FN#420] That is the King of Constantinople.

[FN#421] Cassia fistularis, a kind of carob: "" Shambar"" is the
Arab. form of the Persian "" Chambar.""

[FN#422] Koran, ii. 149. Hence the vulgar idea that Martyrs are still alive in the flesh. See my Pilgrimage (ii. 110 and elsewhere) for the romantic and picturesque consequences of that belief. The Commentators (Jal√°l al-D√≠n, etc.) play tricks with the Koranic words, "" they (martyrs) are not dead but living"" (iii. 179) by placing the happy souls in the crops of green birds which eat of the fruits and drink of the waters of Paradise; whereas the reprobates and the (very) wicked are deposited in black birds which drain the sanies and the boiling waters of Hell. Amongst the Greeks a body remaining entire long after death suggests Anathema Maranatha: it is the contrary with Catholic Christians (Boccaccio iv. 5, of the Pot of Basil). Concerning this creed see Maundrell, Letter of 1698.

[FN#423] Tor is ""Mount Sinai"" in the Koran (xcv. 1). I have only to repeat my opinion concerning the present site so called: ""It is evident that Jebel Serbal dates only from the early days of Coptic Christianity; that Jebel Musa, its Greek rival, rose after the visions of Helena in the fourth century; whilst the building of the Convent by Justinian belongs to A.D 527. Ras Safs√°fah, its rival to the north, is an affair of yesterday, and may be called the invention of Robinson; and Jebel Katerina, to the south is the property of R√ºppell"" (Midian Revisited i., 237). I would therefore call the ""Sinaitic"" Peninsula, Peninsula of Paran in old days and Peninsula of Tor (from its chief port) in our time. It is still my conviction that the true Mount Sinai will be found in Jabal Ar√°if, or some such unimportant height to the north of the modern Hajj- road from Suez to Akabah. Even about the name (which the Koran writes ""Sain√°"" and ""S√≠n√≠n"") there is a dispute: It is usually derived from the root ""Sanah""=sentis, a bush; but this is not satisfactory. Our eminent Assyriologist, Professor Sayce, would connect it with ""Sin,"" the Assyrian Moon- god as Mount Nebo with the Sun-god and he expects to find there the ruins of a Lunar temple as a Solar fane stands on Ba'al Zapuna (Baal Zephon) or the classical Mount Casius.

[FN#424] Alluding to the miracle of Aaron's rod (the gift of Jethro) as related in the Koran (chapts. vii. 1., xx., etc.), where the Egyptian sorcerers threw down thick ropes which by their magic twisted and coiled like serpents.

[FN#425] Arab. ""Ay√°t"" lit. ""signs,"" here ""miracles of the truth,"" 1. c. Koranic versets as opposed to chapters. The ranks of the enemy represent the latter, sword-cuts the former‚Äîa very persuasive mode of preaching.

[FN#426] Lane (M. E. chapt.. iii.) shows by a sketch the position of the worshipper during this ""Sal√°m"" which is addressed, some say, to the guardian angels, others suppose to all brother-believers and angels.

[FN#427] i.e., where the Syrians found him.

[FN#428] i.e., Dedianus Arabised; a name knightly and plebian.

[FN#429] In such tales the Wazir is usually the sharp-witted man, contrasting with the ""dummy,"" or master.

[FN#430] Carrier-pigeons were extensively used at this time. The Caliph Al-N√°sir li-D√≠ni ll√°h (regn. A.H. 575=1180) was, according to Ibn Khald√∫n, very fond of them. The moderns of Damascus still affect them. My successor, Mr. Consul Kirby Green, wrote an excellent report on pigeon-fancying at Damascus. The so-called Maundeville or Mandeville in A. D. 1322 speaks of carrier-pigeons in Syria as a well-known mode Of intercourse between lord and lord.

[FN#431] Mohammed who declared ""There is no monkery in Al-Islam,"" and who virtually abolished the priest, had an especial aversion to the shaveling (Ruhb√°n). But the ""Gens √¶terna in qu√¢ nemo nascitur"" (Pliny v. 17) managed to appear even in Al-lslam, as Fakirs,, Dervishes, S√∫fis, etc. Of this more hereafter.

[FN#432] i.e. her holiness would act like a fascinating talisman.

[FN#433] The ""smoking out"" practice is common amongst the Arabs: hence Marshal Pelissier's so- called "" barbarity."" The Public is apt to forget that on a campaign the general's first duty is to save his own men by any practice which the laws of fair warfare do not absolutely forbid.

[FN#434] i.e. Mohammed, who promised Heaven and threatened Hell.

[FN#435] Arab. ""Ahr"" or ""ihr,"" fornication or adultery, i.e., irreligion, infidelity as amongst the Hebrews (Isaiah xxiii.17).

[FN#436] A sign of defeat.

[FN#437] In English ""last night"": I have already noted that the Moslem day, like the Jewish and the Scandinavian, begins at sundown; and ""layl "" a night, is often used to denote the twenty- four hours between sunset and sunset, whilst ""yaum,"" a day, would by us be translated in many cases ""battle-day.""

[FN#438] Iterum the ""Himalayan Brothers.""

[FN#439] Again, Mohammed who promised Good to the Good, and vice vers√¢.

[FN#440] They are sad doggrel like most of the pi√®ces d'occasion inserted in The Nights.

[FN#441] Here ""Kahwah"" (coffee) is used in its original sense of strong old wine. The derivation is ""Akh√°""=fastidire fecit, causing disinclination for food, the Matambre (kill- hunger) of the Iberians. In old days the scrupulous called coffee ""Kihwah"" in order to distinguish it from 'Kakwah,"" wine.

[FN#442] i.e. Mohammed, a common title.

[FN#443] That is, fatal to the scoffer and the impious.

[FN#444] Equivalent to our ""The Devil was sick,"" etc.

[FN#445] i.e. to the enemy: the North American Indians (so called) use similar forms of ""inverted speech""; and the Australian aborigines are in no way behind them.

[FN#446] See Vol. i., p. 154 (Night xvi.).

[FN#447] Arab. ""Sauf,"" a particle denoting a near future whereas
""Sa-"" points to one which may be very remote.

[FN#448] From the root ""Shanh""=having a fascinating eye, terrifying. The Irish call the fascinater ""eybitter"" and the victim (who is also rhymed to death) ""eybitten.""

[FN#449] i.e., not like the noble-born, strong in enduring the stress of fight.

[FN#450] i.e., of Abraham. For the Well Zemzem and the Place of Abraham see my Pilgrimage (iii. 171-175, etc.), where I described the water as of salt-bitter taste, like that of Epsom (iii. 203). Sir William Muir (in his excellent life of Mahomet, I. cclviii.) remarks that ""the flavour of stale water bottled up for months would not be a criterion of the same water freshly drawn;"" but soldered tins-full of water drawn a fortnight before are to be had in Calcutta and elsewhere after Pilgrimage time; and analysis would at once detect the salt.

[FN#451] Racing was and is a favourite pastime with those hippomanists, the Arabs; but it contrasts strongly with our civilised form being a trial of endurance rather than of speed. The Prophet is said to have limited betting in these words, ""There shall be no wagering save on the Kuff (camel's foot), the Hafir (hoof of horse, ass, etc.) or the Nasal (arrow-pile or lance head).""

[FN#452] In the Mac. Edit. ""Arman""=Armenia, which has before occurred. The author or scribe here understands by ""C√¶sarea"" not the old Turris Stratonis, Herod's city called after Augustus, but C√¶sareia the capital of Cappadocia (Pliny, vi. 3), the royal residence before called Mazaca (Strabo).

[FN#453] An idiom meaning ""a very fool.""

[FN#454] i.e. K√°na (was) m√° (that which) was (k√°na).

[FN#455] A son being ""the lamp of a dark house.""

[FN#456] When the Israelites refused to receive the Law (the souls of all the Prophets even those unborn being present at the Covenant), Allah tore up the mountain (Sinai which is not mentioned) by the roots and shook it over their heads to terrify them, saying, ""Receive the Law which we have given you with a resolution to keep it"" (Koran chaps. xlx. 170). Much of this story is from the Talmud (Abodah Sar. 2, 2, Tract Sabbath, etc.) whence Al-Islam borrowed so much of its Judaism, as it took Christianity from the Apocryphal New Testament. This tradition is still held by the Israelites, says Mr. Rodwell (p. 333) who refers it to a misunderstanding of Exod. xix. 17, rightly rendered in the E. version ""at the nether part of the mountain.""

[FN#457] Arab. ""Azgh√°n"" = the camel-litters in which women travel.

[FN#458] i.e. to joy foes and dismay friends.

[FN#459] Whose eyes became white (i.e. went blind) with mourning for his son Joseph (Koran, chaps. xii. 84). He recovered his sight when his face was covered with the shirt which Gabriel had given to the youth after his brethren had thrown him into the well.Embed","She said, ""O auspicious King, I have learned that when the sages and physicians were in the presence of King Hardub, he honored them greatly and entrusted the handmaidens to them, instructing that they be taught in various fields of knowledge, philosophy, and refined skills. They diligently set to work fulfilling his wishes. This was the situation with King Hardub. However, when King Omar bin al-Nu'uman returned from hunting and entered his palace, he searched for Princess Abrizah but could not find her, nor could anyone provide information about her whereabouts. This troubled him deeply, and he lamented, 'How could the lady leave the palace without anyone knowing? If my kingdom were at stake, it would be in a dire situation without anyone to govern it! I shall never again indulge in hunting until I have guards at the gates to keep watch!' He was greatly disturbed and felt a heavy heart due to the absence of Princess Abrizah. Just then, his

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming

436,Fast Car,Luke Combs,Gettin' Old,89,"5 ContributorsFast Car Lyrics[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across th–µ border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it m–µans to be livin'

[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruising and entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
Said I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged

Well, it's only out of fear (Only out of fear)

Kicking with my friends overseas car keys for the freaks
Did enough shows, we'll be back again

Wish she lived to be a hundred
So she could see her boy gettin' old
Gettin' grown, takin' care of business
And visions of all the ventures and different riches
Far from penny pinchin' my wishes
And wishing wells
Put my heart and spirit in my lyrics
No regretin', unapologetic even if it don't sell
Tell them motherfuckers I prevail through the struggle
Ran the play, no huddle

1. ""Search & Rescue"" Lyrics[Intro]
I know you might not love me the way I need you to
And I'm not the man that you want me to be
And I know it's hard to forget all the things I've done
And how I've hurt you, how I've let you down

[Verse 1]
I'm still your man, I'm still your everything
I'm still the one who'll take a bullet for your life
I'm still the one who'll do anything to make you smile
I'm still the one who'll take you on a flight to paradise

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that it's hard to forgive
It's hard to see me through your eyes
You're mad, I get it, I'm sorry, I know
I'm trying to do better, I know

[Chorus]
But it seems like I'm still living in your past
Tryna get you out your head, but I can't help it
I'm still trying to be the man that I used to be
So I can save you, can I get a rescue?
Search and rescue, rescue

¬†¬†Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 104th Congress, my fellow Americans: Again we are here in the sanctuary of democracy, and once again our democracy has spoken. So let me begin by congratulating all of you here in the 104th Congress and congratulating you, Mr. Speaker.

¬†¬†If we agree on nothing else tonight, we must agree that the American people certainly voted for change in 1992 and in 1994. And as I look out at you, I know how some of you must have felt in 1992. [Laughter]

¬†¬†I must say that in both years we didn't hear America singing, we heard America shouting. And now all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, must say, ""We hear you. We will work together to earn the jobs you have given us."" For we are the keepers of a sacred trust, and we must be faithful to it in this new and very demanding era.

¬†¬†Over 200 years ago, our Founders changed the entire course of human history by joining together to create a new country based on a single powerful idea: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, . . . endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, and among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.""

¬†¬†It has fallen to every generation since then to preserve that idea, the American idea, and to deepen and expand its meaning in new and different times: to Lincoln and to his Congress to preserve the Union and to end slavery; to Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson to restrain the abuses and excesses of the industrial revolution and to assert our leadership in the world; to Franklin Roosevelt to fight the failure and pain of the Great Depression and to win our country's great struggle against fascism; and to all our Presidents since to fight the cold war. Especially, I recall two who struggled to fight that cold war in partnership with Congresses where the majority was of a different party: to Harry Truman, who summoned us to unparalleled prosperity at home and who built the architecture of the cold war; and to Ronald Reagan, whom we wish well tonight and who exhorted us to carry on until the twilight struggle against communism was won.

¬†¬†In another time of change and challenge, I had the honor to be the first President to be elected in the post-cold-war era, an era marked by the global economy, the information revolution, unparalleled change and opportunity and insecurity for the American people. I came to this hallowed Chamber 2 years ago on a mission, to restore the American dream for all our people and to make sure that we move into the 21st century still the strongest force for freedom and democracy in the entire world. I was determined then to tackle the tough problems too long ignored. In this effort I am frank to say that I have made my mistakes, and I have learned again the importance of humility in all human endeavor. But I am also proud to say tonight that our country is stronger than it was 2 years ago. [Applause] Thank you.

¬†¬†Record numbers of Americans are succeeding in the new global economy. We are at peace, and we are a force for peace and freedom throughout the world. We have almost 6 million new jobs since I became President, and we have the lowest combined rate of unemployment and inflation in 25 years. Our businesses are more productive. And here we have worked to bring the deficit down, to expand trade, to put more police on our streets, to give our citizens more of the tools they need to get an education and to rebuild their own communities.

¬†¬†But the rising tide is not lifting all boats. While our Nation is enjoying peace and prosperity, too many of our people are still working harder and harder, for less and less. While our businesses are restructuring and growing more productive and competitive, too many of our people still can't be sure of having a job next year or even next month. And far more than our material riches are threatened, things far more precious to us, our children, our families, our values.

¬†¬†Our civil life is suffering in America today. Citizens are working together less and shouting at each other more. The common bonds of community which have been the great strength of our country from its very beginning are badly frayed. What are we to do about it?

¬†¬†More than 60 years ago, at the dawn of another new era, President Roosevelt told our Nation, ""New conditions impose new requirements on Government and those who conduct Government."" And from that simple proposition, he shaped the New Deal, which helped to restore our Nation to prosperity and define the relationship between our people and their Government for half a century.

¬†¬†That approach worked in its time. But we today, we face a very different time and very different conditions. We are moving from an industrial age built on gears and sweat to an information age demanding skills and learning and flexibility. Our Government, once a champion of national purpose, is now seen by many as simply a captive of narrow interests, putting more burdens on our citizens rather than equipping them to get ahead. The values that used to hold us all together seem to be coming apart.
¬†¬†So tonight we must forge a new social compact to meet the challenges of this time. As we enter a new era, we need a new set of understandings, not just with Government but, even more important, with one another as Americans.

¬†¬†That's what I want to talk with you about tonight. I call it the New Covenant. But it's grounded in a very, very old idea, that all Americans have not just a right but a solemn responsibility to rise as far as their God-given talents and determination can take them and to give something back to their communities and their country in return. Opportunity and responsibility: They go hand in hand. We can't have one without the other. And our national community can't hold together without both.

¬†¬†Our New Covenant is a new set of understandings for how we can equip our people to meet the challenges of a new economy, how we can change the way our Government works to fit a different time, and, above all, how we can repair the damaged bonds in our society and come together behind our common purpose. We must have dramatic change in our economy, our Government, and ourselves.

¬†¬†My fellow Americans, without regard to party, let us rise to the occasion. Let us put aside partisanship and pettiness and pride. As we embark on this new course, let us put our country first, remembering that regardless of party label, we are all Americans. And let the final test of everything we do be a simple one: Is it good for the American people?

¬†¬†Let me begin by saying that we cannot ask Americans to be better citizens if we are not better servants. You made a good start by passing that law which applies to Congress all the laws you put on the private sector, and I was proud to sign it yesterday. But we have a lot more to do before people really trust the way things work around here. Three times as many lobbyists are in the streets and corridors of Washington as were here 20 years ago. The American people look at their Capital, and they see a city where the well-connected and the well-protected can work the system, but the interests of ordinary citizens are often left out.

¬†¬†As the new Congress opened its doors, lobbyists were still doing business as usual; the gifts, the trips, all the things that people are concerned about haven't stopped. Twice this month you missed opportunities to stop these practices. I know there were other considerations in those votes, but I want to use something that I've heard my Republican friends say from time to time, ""There doesn't have to be a law for everything."" So tonight I ask you to just stop taking the lobbyists' perks. Just stop. We don't have to wait for legislation to pass to send a strong signal to the American people that things are really changing. But I also hope you will send me the strongest possible lobby reform bill, and I'll sign that, too.

¬†¬†We should require lobbyists to tell the people for whom they work what they're spending, what they want. We should also curb the role of big money in elections by capping the cost of campaigns and limiting the influence of PAC's. And as I have said for 3 years, we should work to open the airwaves so that they can be an instrument of democracy, not a weapon of destruction, by giving free TV time to candidates for public office.

¬†¬†When the last Congress killed political reform last year, it was reported in the press that the lobbyists actually stood in the Halls of this sacred building and cheered. This year, let's give the folks at home something to cheer about.

¬†¬†More important, I think we all agree that we have to change the way the Government works. Let's make it smaller, less costly, and smarter; leaner, not meaner. [Applause]

¬†¬†I just told the Speaker the equal time doctrine is alive and well. [Laughter]

¬†¬†The New Covenant approach to governing is as different from the old bureaucratic way as the computer is from the manual typewriter. The old way of governing around here protected organized interests. We should look out for the interests of ordinary people. The old way divided us by interest, constituency, or class. The New Covenant way should unite us behind a common vision of what's best for our country. The old way dispensed services through large, top-down, inflexible bureaucracies. The New Covenant way should shift these resources and decisionmaking from bureaucrats to citizens, injecting choice and competition and individual responsibility into national policy. The old way of governing around here actually seemed to reward failure. The New Covenant way should have built-in incentives to reward success. The old way was centralized here in Washington. The New Covenant way must take hold in the communities all across America. And we should help them to do that.

¬†¬†Our job here is to expand opportunity, not bureaucracy, to empower people to make the most of their own lives, and to enhance our security here at home and abroad. We must not ask Government to do what we should do for ourselves. We should rely on Government as a partner to help us to do more for ourselves and for each other.

¬†¬†I hope very much that as we debate these specific and exciting matters, we can go beyond the sterile discussion between the illusion that there is somehow a program for every problem, on the one hand, and the other illusion that the Government is a source of every problem we have. Our job is to get rid of yesterday's Government so that our own people can meet today's and tomorrow's needs. And we ought to do it together.
¬†¬†You know, for years before I became President, I heard others say they would cut Government and how bad it was, but not much happened. We actually did it. We cut over a quarter of a trillion dollars in spending, more than 300 domestic programs, more than 100,000 positions from the Federal bureaucracy in the last 2 years alone. Based on decisions already made, we will have cut a total of more than a quarter of a million positions from the Federal Government, making it the smallest it has been since John Kennedy was President, by the time I come here again next year.

¬†¬†Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, our initiatives have already saved taxpayers $63 billion. The age of the $500 hammer and the ashtray you can break on ""David Letterman"" is gone. Deadwood programs, like mohair subsidies, are gone. We've streamlined the Agriculture Department by reducing it by more than 1,200 offices. We've slashed the small business loan form from an inch thick to a single page. We've thrown away the Government's 10,000page personnel manual.

¬†¬†And the Government is working better in important ways: FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has gone from being a disaster to helping people in disasters. You can ask the farmers in the Middle West who fought the flood there or the people in California who have dealt with floods and earthquakes and fires, and they'll tell you that. Government workers, working hand in hand with private business, rebuilt southern California's fractured freeways in record time and under budget. And because the Federal Government moved fast, all but one of the 5,600 schools damaged in the earthquake are back in business.

¬†¬†Now, there are a lot of other things that I could talk about. I want to just mention one because it will be discussed here in the next few weeks. University administrators all over the country have told me that they are saving weeks and weeks of bureaucratic time now because of our direct college loan program, which makes college loans cheaper and more affordable with better repayment terms for students, costs the Government less, and cuts out paperwork and bureaucracy for the Government and for the universities. We shouldn't cap that program. We should give every college in America the opportunity to be a part of it.

¬†¬†Previous Government programs gathered dust. The reinventing Government report is getting results. And we're not through. There's going to be a second round of reinventing Government. We propose to cut $130 billion in spending by shrinking departments, extending our freeze on domestic spending, cutting 60 public housing programs down to 3, getting rid of over 100 programs we do not need, like the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Helium Reserve Program. And we're working on getting rid of unnecessary regulations and making them more sensible. The programs and regulations that have outlived their usefulness should go. We have to cut yesterday's Government to help solve tomorrow's problems.

¬†¬†And we need to get Government closer to the people it's meant to serve. We need to help move programs down to the point where States and communities and private citizens in the private sector can do a better job. If they can do it, we ought to let them do it. We should get out of the way and let them do what they can do better. Taking power away from Federal bureaucracies and giving it back to communities and individuals is something everyone should be able to be for.

¬†¬†It's time for Congress to stop passing on to the States the cost of decisions we make here in Washington. I know there are still serious differences over the details of the unfunded mandates legislation, but I want to work with you to make sure we pass a reasonable bill which will protect the national interests and give justified relief where we need to give it.

¬†¬†For years, Congress concealed in the budget scores of pet spending projects. Last year was no difference. There was a $1 million to study stress in plants and $12 million for a tick removal program that didn't work. It's hard to remove ticks. Those of us who have had them know. [Laughter] But I'll tell you something, if you'll give me line-item veto, I'll remove some of that unnecessary spending.

¬†¬†But I think we should all remember, and almost all of us would agree, that Government still has important responsibilities. Our young people‚Äîwe should think of this when we cut‚Äî our young people hold our future in their hands. We still owe a debt to our veterans. And our senior citizens have made us what we are. Now, my budget cuts a lot. But it protects education, veterans, Social Security, and Medicare, and I hope you will do the same thing. You should, and I hope you will.

¬†¬†And when we give more flexibility to the States, let us remember that there are certain fundamental national needs that should be addressed in every State, North and South, East and West: Immunization against childhood disease, school lunches in all our schools, Head Start, medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants, all these things, all these things are in the national interest.

¬†¬†I applaud your desire to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations. But when we deregulate, let's remember what national action in the national interest has given us: safer food for our families, safer toys for our children, safer nursing homes for our parents, safer cars and highways, and safer workplaces, cleaner air, and cleaner water. Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations? You bet we do. But we can have common sense and still provide for safe drinking water. We can have fairness and still clean up toxic dumps, and we ought to do it.

¬†¬†Should we cut the deficit more? Well, of course we should. Of course we should. But we can bring it down in a way that still protects our economic recovery and does not unduly punish people who should not be punished but instead should be helped.

¬†¬†I know many of you in this Chamber support the balanced budget amendment. I certainly want to balance the budget. Our administration has done more to bring the budget down and to save money than any in a very, very long time. If you believe passing this amendment is the right thing to do, then you have to be straight with the American people. They have a right to know what you're going to cut, what taxes you're going to raise, and how it's going to affect them. We should be doing things in the open around here. For example, everybody ought to know if this proposal is going to endanger Social Security. I would oppose that, and I think most Americans would.
¬†¬†Nothing has done more to undermine our sense of common responsibility than our failed welfare system. This is one of the problems we have to face here in Washington in our New Covenant. It rewards welfare over work. It undermines family values. It lets millions of parents get away without paying their child support.

¬†¬†It keeps a minority but a significant minority of the people on welfare trapped on it for a very long time.

¬†¬†I've worked on this problem for a long time, nearly 15 years now. As a Governor, I had the honor of working with the Reagan administration to write the last welfare reform bill back in 1988. In the last 2 years, we made a good start at continuing the work of welfare reform. Our administration gave two dozen States the right to slash through Federal rules and regulations to reform their own welfare systems and to try to promote work and responsibility over welfare and dependency.

¬†¬†Last year I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform plan ever presented by an administration. We have to make welfare what it was meant to be, a second chance, not a way of life. We have to help those on welfare move to work as quickly as possible, to provide child care and teach them skills, if that's what they need, for up to 2 years. And after that, there ought to be a simple, hard rule: Anyone who can work must go to work. If a parent isn't paying child support, they should be forced to pay. We should suspend drivers' license, track them across State lines, make them work off what they owe. That is what we should do. Governments do not raise children, people do. And the parents must take responsibility for the children they bring into this world.

¬†¬†I want to work with you, with all of you, to pass welfare reform. But our goal must be to liberate people and lift them up from dependence to independence, from welfare to work, from mere childbearing to responsible parenting. Our goal should not be to punish them because they happen to be poor.

¬†¬†We should, we should require work and mutual responsibility. But we shouldn't cut people off just because they're poor, they're young, or even because they're unmarried. We should promote responsibility by requiring young mothers to live at home with their parents or in other supervised settings, by requiring them to finish school. But we shouldn't put them and their children out on the street. And I know all the arguments, pro and con, and I have read and thought about this for a long time. I still don't think we can in good conscience punish poor children for the mistakes of their parents.

¬†¬†My fellow Americans, every single survey shows that all the American people care about this without regard to party or race or region.

¬†¬†So let this be the year we end welfare as we know it. But also let this be the year that we are all able to stop using this issue to divide America. No one is more eager to end welfare‚Äî [Applause]‚ÄîI may be the only President who has actually had the opportunity to sit in a welfare office, who's actually spent hours and hours talking to people on welfare. And I am telling you, the people who are trapped on it know it doesn't work; they also want to get off. So we can promote, together, education and work and good parenting. I have no problem with punishing bad behavior or the refusal to be a worker or a student or a responsible parent. I just don't want to punish poverty and past mistakes. All of us have made our mistakes, and none of us can change our yesterdays. But every one of us can change our tomorrows. And America's best example of that may be Lynn Woolsey, who worked her way off welfare to become a Congresswoman from the State of California.

¬†¬†I know the Members of this Congress are concerned about crime, as are all the citizens of our country. And I remind you that last year we passed a very tough crime bill: longer sentences, ""three strikes and you're out,"" almost 60 new capital punishment offenses, more prisons, more prevention, 100,000 more police. And we paid for it all by reducing the size of the Federal bureaucracy and giving the money back to local communities to lower the crime rate.

¬†¬†There may be other things we can do to be tougher on crime, to be smarter with crime, to help to lower that rate first. Well, if there are, let's talk about them, and let's do them. But let's not go back on the things that we did last year that we know work, that we know work because the local law enforcement officers tell us that we did the right thing, because local community leaders who have worked for years and years to lower the crime rate tell us that they work. Let's look at the experience of our cities and our rural areas where the crime rate has gone down and ask the people who did it how they did it. And if what we did last year supports the decline in the crime rate‚Äî and I am convinced that it does‚Äîlet us not go back on it. Let's stick with it, implement it. We've got 4 more hard years of work to do to do that.

¬†¬†I don't want to destroy the good atmosphere in the room or in the country tonight, but I have to mention one issue that divided this body greatly last year. The last Congress also passed the Brady bill and, in the crime bill, the ban on 19 assault weapons. I don't think it's a secret to anybody in this room that several Members of the last Congress who voted for that aren't here tonight because they voted for it. And I know, therefore, that some of you who are here because they voted for it are under enormous pressure to repeal it. I just have to tell you how I feel about it.

¬†¬†The Members of Congress who voted for that bill and I would never do anything to infringe on the right to keep and bear arms to hunt and to engage in other appropriate sporting activities. I've done it since I was a boy, and I'm going to keep right on doing it until I can't do it anymore. But a lot of people laid down their seats in Congress so that police officers and kids wouldn't have to lay down their lives under a hail of assault weapon attack, and I will not let that be repealed. I will not let it be repealed.

¬†¬†I'd like to talk about a couple of other issues we have to deal with. I want us to cut more spending, but I hope we won't cut Government programs that help to prepare us for the new economy, promote responsibility, and are organized from the grassroots up, not by Federal bureaucracy. The very best example of this is the national service corps, AmeriCorps. It passed with strong bipartisan support. And now there are 20,000 Americans, more than ever served in one year in the Peace Corps, working all over this country, helping people person-to-person in local grassroots volunteer groups, solving problems, and in the process earning some money for their education. This is citizenship at its best. It's good for the AmeriCorps members, but it's good for the rest of us, too. It's the essence of the New Covenant, and we shouldn't stop it.

¬†¬†All Americans, not only in the States most heavily affected but in every place in this country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens. In the budget I will present to you, we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. We are a nation of immigrants. But we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.

¬†¬†The most important job of our Government in this new era is to empower the American people to succeed in the global economy. America has always been a land of opportunity, a land where, if you work hard, you can get ahead. We've become a great middle class country. Middle class values sustain us. We must expand that middle class and shrink the under class, even as we do everything we can to support the millions of Americans who are already successful in the new economy.

¬†¬†America is once again the world's strongest economic power: almost 6 million new jobs in the last 2 years, exports booming, inflation down. High-wage jobs are coming back. A record number of American entrepreneurs are living the American dream. If we want it to stay that way, those who work and lift our Nation must have more of its benefits.

¬†¬†Today, too many of those people are being left out. They're working harder for less. They have less security, less income, less certainty that they can even afford a vacation, much less college for their kids or retirement for themselves. We cannot let this continue. If we don't act, our economy will probably keep doing what it's been doing since about 1978, when the income growth began to go to those at the very top of our economic scale and the people in the vast middle got very little growth, and people who worked like crazy but were on the bottom then fell even further and further behind in the years afterward, no matter how hard they worked.

¬†¬†We've got to have a Government that can be a real partner in making this new economy work for all of our people, a Government that helps each and every one of us to get an education and to have the opportunity to renew our skills. That's why we worked so hard to increase educational opportunities in the last 2 years, from Head Start to public schools, to apprenticeships for young people who don't go to college, to making college loans more available and more affordable. That's the first thing we have to do. We've got to do something to empower people to improve their skills.

¬†¬†The second thing we ought to do is to help people raise their incomes immediately by lowering their taxes. We took the first step in 1993 with a working family tax cut for 15 million families with incomes under $27,000, a tax cut that this year will average about $1,000 a family. And we also gave tax reductions to most small and new businesses. Before we could do more than that, we first had to bring down the deficit we inherited, and we had to get economic growth up. Now we've done both. And now we can cut taxes in a more comprehensive way. But tax cuts should reinforce and promote our first obligation: to empower our citizens through education and training to make the most of their own lives. The spotlight should shine on those who make the right choices for themselves, their families, and their communities.

¬†¬†I have proposed the middle class bill of rights, which should properly be called the bill of rights and responsibilities because its provisions only benefit those who are working to educate and raise their children and to educate themselves. It will, therefore, give needed tax relief and raise incomes in both the short run and the long run in a way that benefits all of us.

¬†¬†There are four provisions. First, a tax deduction for all education and training after high school. If you think about it, we permit businesses to deduct their investment, we permit individuals to deduct interest on their home mortgages, but today an education is even more important to the economic well-being of our whole country than even those things are. We should do everything we can to encourage it. And I hope you will support it. Second, we ought to cut taxes $500 for families with children under 13. Third, we ought to foster more savings and personal responsibility by permitting people to establish an individual retirement account and withdraw from it, tax-free, for the cost of education, health care, first-time homebuying, or the care of a parent. And fourth, we should pass a ""GI bill"" for America's workers. We propose to collapse nearly 70 Federal programs and not give the money to the States but give the money directly to the American people, offer vouchers to them so that they, if they're laid off or if they're working for a very low wage, can get a voucher worth $2,600 a year for up to 2 years to go to their local community colleges or wherever else they want to get the skills they need to improve their lives. Let's empower people in this way, move it from the Government directly to the workers of America.

¬†¬†Now, any one of us can call for a tax cut, but I won't accept one that explodes the deficit or puts our recovery at risk. We ought to pay for our tax cuts fully and honestly.

¬†¬†Just 2 years ago, it was an open question whether we would find the strength to cut the deficit. Thanks to the courage of the people who were here then, many of whom didn't return, we did cut the deficit. We began to do what others said would not be done. We cut the deficit by over $600 billion, about $10,000 for every family in this country. It's coming down 3 years in a row for the first time since Mr. Truman was President, and I don't think anybody in America wants us to let it explode again.

¬†¬†In the budget I will send you, the middle class bill of rights is fully paid for by budget cuts in bureaucracy, cuts in programs, cuts in special interest subsidies. And the spending cuts will more than double the tax cuts. My budget pays for the middle class bill of rights without any cuts in Medicare. And I will oppose any attempts to pay for tax cuts with Medicare cuts. That's not the right thing to do.

¬†¬†I know that a lot of you have your own ideas about tax relief, and some of them I find quite interesting. I really want to work with all of you. My test for our proposals will be: Will it create jobs and raise incomes; will it strengthen our families and support our children; is it paid for; will it build the middle class and shrink the under class? If it does, I'll support it. But if it doesn't, I won't.

¬†¬†The goal of building the middle class and shrinking the under class is also why I believe that you should raise the minimum wage. It rewards work. Two and a half million Americans, two and a half million Americans, often women with children, are working out there today for $4.25 an hour. In terms of real buying power, by next year that minimum wage will be at a 40-year low. That's not my idea of how the new economy ought to work.

¬†¬†Now, I've studied the arguments and the evidence for and against a minimum wage increase. I believe the weight of the evidence is that a modest increase does not cost jobs and may even lure people back into the job market. But the most important thing is, you can't make a living on $4.25 an hour, especially if you have children, even with the working families tax cut we passed last year. In the past, the minimum wage has been a bipartisan issue, and I think it should be again. So I want to challenge you to have honest hearings on this, to get together, to find a way to make the minimum wage a living wage.

¬†¬†Members of Congress have been here less than a month, but by the end of the week, 28 days into the new year, every Member of Congress will have earned as much in congressional salary as a minimum wage worker makes all year long.

¬†¬†Everybody else here, including the President, has something else that too many Americans do without, and that's health care. Now, last year we almost came to blows over health care, but we didn't do anything. And the cold, hard fact is that, since last year, since I was here, another 1.1 million Americans in working families have lost their health care. And the cold, hard fact is that many millions more, most of them farmers and small business people and self-employed people, have seen their premiums skyrocket, their copays and deductibles go up. There's a whole bunch of people in this country that in the statistics have health insurance but really what they've got is a piece of paper that says they won't lose their home if they get sick.

¬†¬†Now, I still believe our country has got to move toward providing health security for every American family. But I know that last year, as the evidence indicates, we bit off more than we could chew. So I'm asking you that we work together. Let's do it step by step. Let's do whatever we have to do to get something done. Let's at least pass meaningful insurance reform so that no American risks losing coverage for facing skyrocketing prices, that nobody loses their coverage because they face high prices or unavailable insurance when they change jobs or lose a job or a family member gets sick.

¬†¬†I want to work together with all of you who have an interest in this, with the Democrats who worked on it last time, with the Republican leaders like Senator Dole, who has a longtime commitment to health care reform and made some constructive proposals in this area last year. We ought to make sure that self-employed people in small businesses can buy insurance at more affordable rates through voluntary purchasing pools. We ought to help families provide long-term care for a sick parent or a disabled child. We can work to help workers who lose their jobs at least keep their health insurance coverage for a year while they look for work. And we can find a way‚Äîit may take some time, but we can find a way‚Äîto make sure that our children have health care.

¬†¬†You know, I think everybody in this room, without regard to party, can be proud of the fact that our country was rated as having the world's most productive economy for the first time in nearly a decade. But we can't be proud of the fact that we're the only wealthy country in the world that has a smaller percentage of the work force and their children with health insurance today than we did 10 years ago, the last time we were the most productive economy in the world. So let's work together on this. It is too important for politics as usual.

¬†¬†Much of what the American people are thinking about tonight is what we've already talked about. A lot of people think that the security concerns of America today are entirely internal to our borders. They relate to the security of our jobs and our homes and our incomes and our children, our streets, our health, and protecting those borders. Now that the cold war has passed, it's tempting to believe that all the security issues, with the possible exception of trade, reside here at home. But it's not so. Our security still depends upon our continued world leadership for peace and freedom and democracy. We still can't be strong at home unless we're strong abroad.

¬†¬†The financial crisis in Mexico is a case in point. I know it's not popular to say it tonight, but we have to act, not for the Mexican people but for the sake of the millions of Americans whose livelihoods are tied to Mexico's wellbeing. If we want to secure American jobs, preserve American exports, safeguard America's borders, then we must pass the stabilization program and help to put Mexico back on track.

¬†¬†Now let me repeat: It's not a loan. It's not foreign aid. It's not a bailout. We will be given a guarantee like cosigning a note, with good collateral that will cover our risks. This legislation is the right thing for America. That's why the bipartisan leadership has supported it. And I hope you in Congress will pass it quickly. It is in our interest, and we can explain it to the American people because we're going to do it in the right way.

¬†¬†You know, tonight, this is the first State of the Union Address ever delivered since the beginning of the cold war when not a single Russian missile is pointed at the children of America. And along with the Russians, we're on our way to destroying the missiles and the bombers that carry 9,000 nuclear warheads. We've come so far so fast in this post-cold-war world that it's easy to take the decline of the nuclear threat for granted. But it's still there, and we aren't finished yet.

¬†¬†This year I'll ask the Senate to approve START II to eliminate weapons that carry 5,000 more warheads. The United States will lead the charge to extend indefinitely the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to enact a comprehensive nuclear test ban, and to eliminate chemical weapons. To stop and roll back North Korea's potentially deadly nuclear program, we'll continue to implement the agreement we have reached with that nation. It's smart. It's tough. It's a deal based on continuing inspection with safeguards for our allies and ourselves.

¬†¬†This year I'll submit to Congress comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combating terrorists, whether they strike at home or abroad. As the cowards who bombed the World Trade Center found out, this country will hunt down terrorists and bring them to justice.

¬†¬†Just this week, another horrendous terrorist act in Israel killed 19 and injured scores more. On behalf of the American people and all of you, I send our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims. I know that in the face of such evil, it is hard for the people in the Middle East to go forward. But the terrorists represent the past, not the future. We must and we will pursue a comprehensive peace between Israel and all her neighbors in the Middle East.

¬†¬†Accordingly, last night I signed an Executive order that will block the assets in the United States of terrorist organizations that threaten to disrupt the peace process. It prohibits financial transactions with these groups. And tonight I call on all our allies and peace-loving nations throughout the world to join us with renewed fervor in a global effort to combat terrorism. We cannot permit the future to be marred by terror and fear and paralysis.

¬†¬†From the day I took the oath of office, I pledged that our Nation would maintain the best equipped, best trained, and best prepared military on Earth. We have, and they are. They have managed the dramatic downsizing of our forces after the cold war with remarkable skill and spirit. But to make sure our military is ready for action and to provide the pay and the quality of life the military and their families deserve, I'm asking the Congress to add $25 billion in defense spending over the next 6 years.

¬†¬†I have visited many bases at home and around the world since I became President. Tonight I repeat that request with renewed conviction. We ask a very great deal of our Armed Forces. Now that they are smaller in number, we ask more of them. They go out more often to more different places and stay longer. They are called to service in many, many ways. And we must give them and their families what the times demand and what they have earned.

¬†¬†Just think about what our troops have done in the last year, showing America at its best, helping to save hundreds of thousands of people in Rwanda, moving with lightning speed to head off another threat to Kuwait, giving freedom and democracy back to the people of Haiti. We have proudly supported peace and prosperity and freedom from South Africa to Northern Ireland, from Central and Eastern Europe to Asia, from Latin America to the Middle East. All these endeavors are good in those places, but they make our future more confident and more secure.

¬†¬†Well, my fellow Americans, that's my agenda for America's future: expanding opportunity, not bureaucracy; enhancing security at home and abroad; empowering our people to make the most of their own lives. It's ambitious and achievable, but it's not enough. We even need more than new ideas for changing the world or equipping Americans to compete in the new economy, more than a Government that's smaller, smarter, and wiser, more than all of the changes we can make in Government and in the private sector from the outside in.

¬†¬†Our fortunes and our posterity also depend upon our ability to answer some questions from within, from the values and voices that speak to our hearts as well as our heads; voices that tell us we have to do more to accept responsibility for ourselves and our families, for our communities, and yes, for our fellow citizens. We see our families and our communities all over this country coming apart, and we feel the common ground shifting from under us. The PTA, the town hall meeting, the ball park, it's hard for a lot of overworked parents to find the time and space for those things that strengthen the bonds of trust and cooperation. Too many of our children don't even have parents and grandparents who can give them those experiences that they need to build their own character and their sense of identity.

¬†¬†We all know that while we here in this Chamber can make a difference on those things, that the real differences will be made by our fellow citizens, where they work and where they live and that it will be made almost without regard to party. When I used to go to the softball park in Little Rock to watch my daughter's league and people would come up to me, fathers and mothers, and talk to me, I can honestly say I had no idea whether 90 percent of them were Republicans or Democrats. When I visited the relief centers after the floods in California, northern California, last week, a woman came up to me and did something that very few of you would do. She hugged me and said, ""Mr. President, I'm a Republican, but I'm glad you're here."" [Laughter]

¬†¬†Now, why? We can't wait for disasters to act the way we used to act every day, because as we move into this next century, everybody matters. We don't have a person to waste. And a lot of people are losing a lot of chances to do better. That means that we need a New Covenant for everybody.

¬†¬†For our corporate and business leaders, we're going to work here to keep bringing the deficit down, to expand markets, to support their success in every possible way. But they have an obligation when they're doing well to keep jobs in our communities and give their workers a fair share of the prosperity they generate.

¬†¬†For people in the entertainment industry in this country, we applaud your creativity and your worldwide success, and we support your freedom of expression. But you do have a responsibility to assess the impact of your work and to understand the damage that comes from the incessant, repetitive, mindless violence and irresponsible conduct that permeates our media all the time.

¬†¬†We've got to ask our community leaders and all kinds of organizations to help us stop our most serious social problem, the epidemic of teen pregnancies and births where there is no marriage. I have sent to Congress a plan to target schools all over this country with antipregnancy programs that work. But Government can only do so much. Tonight I call on parents and leaders all across this country to join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to make a difference. We can do this, and we must.

¬†¬†And I would like to say a special word to our religious leaders. You know, I'm proud of the fact the United States has more houses of worship per capita than any country in the world. These people who lead our houses of worship can ignite their congregations to carry their faith into action, can reach out to all of our children, to all of the people in distress, to those who have been savaged by the breakdown of all we hold dear. Because so much of what must be done must come from the inside out and our religious leaders and their congregations can make all the difference, they have a role in the New Covenant as well.

¬†¬†There must be more responsibility for all of our citizens. You know, it takes a lot of people to help all the kids in trouble stay off the streets and in school. It takes a lot of people to build the Habitat for Humanity houses that the Speaker celebrates on his lapel pin. It takes a lot of people to provide the people power for all of the civic organizations in this country that made our communities mean so much to most of us when we were kids. It takes every parent to teach the children the difference between right and wrong and to encourage them to learn and grow and to say no to the wrong things but also to believe that they can be whatever they want to be.

¬†¬†I know it's hard when you're working harder for less, when you're under great stress, to do these things. A lot of our people don't have the time or the emotional stress, they think, to do the work of citizenship.

¬†¬†Most of us in politics haven't helped very much. For years, we've mostly treated citizens like they were consumers or spectators, sort of political couch potatoes who were supposed to watch the TV ads either promise them something for nothing or play on their fears and frustrations. And more and more of our citizens now get most of their information in very negative and aggressive ways that are hardly conducive to honest and open conversations. But the truth is, we have got to stop seeing each other as enemies just because we have different views.

¬†¬†If you go back to the beginning of this country, the great strength of America, as de Tocqueville pointed out when he came here a long time ago, has always been our ability to associate with people who were different from ourselves and to work together to find common ground. And in this day, everybody has a responsibility to do more of that. We simply cannot want for a tornado, a fire, or a flood to behave like Americans ought to behave in dealing with one another.

¬†¬†I want to finish up here by pointing out some folks that are up with the First Lady that represent what I'm trying to talk about‚Äîcitizens. I have no idea what their party affiliation is or who they voted for in the last election. But they represent what we ought to be doing.

¬†¬†Cindy Perry teaches second graders to read in AmeriCorps in rural Kentucky. She gains when she gives. She's a mother of four. She says that her service inspired her to get her high school equivalency last year. She was married when she was a teenager‚Äîstand up, Cindy. She was married when she was a teenager. She had four children. But she had time to serve other people, to get her high school equivalency, and she's going to use her AmeriCorps money to go back to college.

¬†¬†Chief Stephen Bishop is the police chief of Kansas City. He's been a national leader‚Äîstand up, Steve. He's been a national leader in using more police in community policing, and he's worked with AmeriCorps to do it. And the crime rate in Kansas City has gone down as a result of what he did.

¬†¬†Corporal Gregory Depestre went to Haiti as part of his adopted country's force to help secure democracy in his native land. And I might add, we must be the only country in the world that could have gone to Haiti and taken Haitian-Americans there who could speak the language and talk to the people. And he was one of them, and we're proud of him.

¬†¬†The next two folks I've had the honor of meeting and getting to know a little bit, the Reverend John and the Reverend Diana Cherry of the A.M.E. Zion Church in Temple Hills, Maryland. I'd like to ask them to stand. I want to tell you about them. In the early eighties, they left Government service and formed a church in a small living room in a small house, in the early eighties. Today that church has 17,000 members. It is one of the three or four biggest churches in the entire United States. It grows by 200 a month. They do it together. And the special focus of their ministry is keeping families together.

¬†¬†Two things they did make a big impression on me. I visited their church once, and I learned they were building a new sanctuary closer to the Washington, DC, line in a higher crime, higher drug rate area because they thought it was part of their ministry to change the lives of the people who needed them. The second thing I want to say is that once Reverend Cherry was at a meeting at the White House with some other religious leaders, and he left early to go back to this church to minister to 150 couples that he had brought back to his church from all over America to convince them to come back together, to save their marriages, and to raise their kids. This is the kind of work that citizens are doing in America. We need more of it, and it ought to be lifted up and supported.

¬†¬†The last person I want to introduce is Jack Lucas from Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Jack, would you stand up? Fifty years ago, in the sands of Iwo Jima, Jack Lucas taught and learned the lessons of citizenship. On February 20th, 1945, he and three of his buddies encountered the enemy and two grenades at their feet. Jack Lucas threw himself on both of them. In that moment, he saved the lives of his companions, and miraculously in the next instant, a medic saved his life. He gained a foothold for freedom, and at the age of 17, just a year older than his grandson who is up there with him today‚Äî and his son, who is a West Point graduate and a veteran‚Äîat 17, Jack Lucas became the youngest Marine in history and the youngest soldier in this century to win the Congressional Medal of Honor. All these years later, yesterday, here's what he said about that day: ""It didn't matter where you were from or who you were, you relied on one another. You did it for your country.""

¬†¬†We all gain when we give, and we reap what we sow. That's at the heart of this New Covenant. Responsibility, opportunity, and citizenship, more than stale chapters in some remote civic book, they're still the virtue by which we can fulfill ourselves and reach our God-given potential and be like them and also to fulfill the eternal promise of this country, the enduring dream from that first and most sacred covenant. I believe every person in this country still believes that we are created equal and given by our Creator the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This is a very, very great country. And our best days are still to come.

¬†¬†Thank you, and God bless you all.

It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

[Verse 2]
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done

[Chorus]
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

[Verse 3]
I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

I go there nearly every night, I find the accents so familiar...
If I heard one here in town, I'd spin myself around
To see who was talking like they were on TV
From America!

Steam rises from pavements in this strange world
Of fire escapes and trash cans
Muted brass sets the tone of the scene
And though the backdrop's not that clean
There's always someone on hand to sort it out - in America

Bruce Willis has the airport locked down and
Hollywood superstars are running the town
Peter Parker writes it all in the free press
(While his editor puts him under serious duress)
And if I ate Italian, well I might be scared
That some kind of gunfight would break out down the stairs
Jack Bauer's 'gone dark' and there's an APB
It's a hell of a job defending the Land Of The Free

But it looks alright! In the TV light
America, is that you?
Or did we get it right?
You might also likeI know your monuments by heart
Climbed down Mount Rushmore in the moonlight
(I've never been to Dakota though
I just dropped in for the show
Bought my North By Northwest poster - at HMV)

And so I guess I'd be nervous waiting for a Greyhound Bus
Although the people around me might not see the fuss
But maybe if a crop duster was doing the nearby fields
They'd be running just like me?
And if I met some end in a backstreet night
The cops'd have the coffee and donuts ready by first light
And maybe if I was lucky I'd get Sandra Bullock on the case
Any my Greyhound Bus would get me any place!

[II. Cops & Boxes]

America, did we get it right?
Or is what I see from the chair in my room
Some kind of illusion through the Yorkshire gloom
Oh America, do we see it right?
Oh you've got people swinging from buildings
(And a bomb's just about to go off, one man armies on every street corner - so I wouldn't worry, that guy in the deli is probably some kind of ex-marine)
Hey will you save me from the End Of The World
From the curse of the Bad Guys, 'cos that's what I heard
Oh America, do we see you right?
[III. On The Road Again]

Let's take the Freeway, try to lose the town
Let's eat some distance, see what's goin' down
I'll be Dennis Hopper, you be Thelma (or Louise)
We'll kick up dust as the sun strobes through the trees
And we'll have ourselves a real Easy Ride

A Motel hoarding looms out of the dust
Abandoned steelworks glowing with rust
Watching all those telegraph wires
Follow the eternal yellow line

We're on the Road again!
We're on the Road

And I'm half hoping that some guy in a truck
Is gonna chase me through the landscape (be just my luck)
I wanna stop at diners where they spit on the floor
And give you long, cold looks when you walk through the door

Rivers getting deeper, mountains getting high
Roads are getting smaller 'neath the bigger, bluer sky
Bridges made of matchwood in a country made of iron
And ""Jesus Saves"" - if you believe the signs
Fin-tailed Caddies and thick milk shakes
Dunkin' Donuts and screeching brakes
Tarantino makes it all live again
(With a 'Motherfucker' dropped in, every now and then)
We're on the road.....

[IV. The Inner Heart]

And far from the Freeway
Where we find your inner heart
Of Cowboys and Cacti, Meth Labs and Mountains
Holes in the desert with the bodies of gangsters
Or Indians from the movies...

Rattlesnakes
And Salt Lakes
All here
All true
Under the unrelenting sun
And deep underground
They're at Def Con One

[V. San Francisco]

I've seen this town in ruins, its bridges broken twice
I've seen it take an earthquake, bombarded by ice
Attacked by giant lizards and levelled to the ground
I've seen it in the future when there's no-one around
But you can still buy a pizza

And half the region's folklore comes from the city jails
Whether it's Clint or Johnny Cash, the underdog prevails
I've walked the Wharf with James Bond, seen Gandalf lift the bridge
I was safely in England when the aliens made their pitch

Oh San Francisco, what a world! What a place! What a life!

The future home of Starfleet, the LAST home of the whales
(A Bird of Prey still rusting beneath your silver waves)
Skyscraper infernoes, militia on The Rock
Volkswagens that drive themselves
And apes that freely talk

Oh San Francisco, what a world! What a place! What a life!

[spoken]
Who's the band that gets all the chicks?
The Tangent!
You're damn right!

Oh San Francisco, what a world! What a place! What a life!

The Tangent!

Oh San Francisco, what a world! What a place! What a life!
Oh San Francisco, what a world! What a place! What a life!

America, did we get it right?
San Francisco, San Francisco
America, did we get it right?
Oh San Francisco, what a world! What a place! What a life!

But I'm just eavesdropping on an LED screen
From the centre of England, can I believe what I've seen?
Will I ever walk those streets again?

[VI. The American Watchworld (Reprise)]

America, my love affair goes on
That faith in flag and proud salute still touch me
As in your world of men, you save the President again
And have your troops back home in time for the parade

Once again, tears fill my eyes
As the future hero drops his first catch
But the montage you make will show him
Gain wisdom as he grows
And we all wish we could grow up like him

Somebody pour me a double shot
Been gettin' better by the day, but tonight I drink

You say I gotta get over you and get sober too
I got a lot of habits I gotta kick
But weigh out all your options and take your pick

Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you, want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time

But I'm pretty sure I'm drowning in this town

And I'll never tell you how much I'm missin' you
But I know I'm missin' you

And I'll never tell you how much I need you
But I know I need you

I'll never tell you how much I'm missin' you
But I know I'm missin' you

And I'll never tell you how much I need you
But I know I need you

458,Gold Leaf,Apollo 13,Gold Leaf,32,"14 ContributorsDe Profundis Lyrics. . . Suffering is one very long moment.  We cannot divide it by seasons.  We can only record its moods, and chronicle their return.  With us time itself does not progress.  It revolves.  It seems to circle round one centre of pain.  The paralysing immobility of a life every circumstance of which is regulated after an unchangeable pattern, so that we eat and drink and lie down and pray, or kneel at least for prayer, according to the inflexible laws of an iron formula: this immobile quality, that makes each dreadful day in the very minutest detail like its brother, seems to communicate itself to those external forces the very essence of whose existence is ceaseless change.  Of seed-time or harvest, of the reapers bending over the corn, or the grape gatherers threading through the vines, of the grass in the orchard made white with broken blossoms or strewn with fallen fruit: of these we know nothing and can know nothing.

For us there is only one season, the season of sorrow.  The very sun and moon seem taken from us.  Outside, the day may be blue and gold, but the light that creeps down through the thickly-muffled glass of the small iron-barred window beneath which one sits is grey and niggard. It is always twilight in one‚Äôs cell, as it is always twilight in one‚Äôs heart. And in the sphere of thought, no less than in the sphere of time, motion is no more.  The thing that you personally have long ago forgotten, or can easily forget, is happening to me now, and will happen to me again to-morrow.  Remember this, and you will be able to understand a little of why I am writing, and in this manner writing. . . .
A week later, I am transferred here. Three more months go over and my mother dies.  No one knew how deeply I loved and honoured her.  Her death was terrible to me; but I, once a lord of language, have no words in which to express my anguish and my shame. She and my father had bequeathed me a name they had made noble and honoured, not merely in literature, art, archaeology, and science, but in the public history of my own country, in its evolution as a nation. I had disgraced that name eternally.  I had made it a low by-word among low people.  I had dragged it through the very mire.  I had given it to brutes that they might make it brutal, and to fools that they might turn it into a synonym for folly. What I suffered then, and still suffer, is not for pen to write or paper to record.  My wife, always kind and gentle to me, rather than that I should hear the news from indifferent lips, travelled, ill as she was, all the way from Genoa to England to break to me herself the tidings of so irreparable, so irremediable, a loss.  Messages of sympathy reached me from all who had still affection for me.  Even people who had not known me personally, hearing that a new sorrow had broken into my life, wrote to ask that some expression of their condolence should be conveyed to me. . . .
Three months go over.  The calendar of my daily conduct and labour that hangs on the outside of my cell door, with my name and sentence written upon it, tells me that it is May. . . .

Prosperity, pleasure and success, may be rough of grain and common in fibre, but sorrow is the most sensitive of all created things.  There is nothing that stirs in the whole world of thought to which sorrow does not vibrate in terrible and exquisite pulsation.  The thin beaten-out leaf of tremulous gold that chronicles the direction of forces the eye cannot see is in comparison coarse.  It is a wound that bleeds when any hand but that of love touches it, and even then must bleed again, though not in pain.

Where there is sorrow there is holy ground.  Some day people will realise what that means.  They will know nothing of life till they do,‚Äîand natures like his can realise it.  When I was brought down from my prison to the Court of Bankruptcy, between two policemen,‚Äîwaited in the long dreary corridor that, before the whole crowd, whom an action so sweet and simple hushed into silence, he might gravely raise his hat to me, as, handcuffed and with bowed head, I passed him by.  Men have gone to heaven for smaller things than that.  It was in this spirit, and with this mode of love, that the saints knelt down to wash the feet of the poor, or stooped to kiss the leper on the cheek.  I have never said one single word to him about what he did.  I do not know to the present moment whether he is aware that I was even conscious of his action.  It is not a thing for which one can render formal thanks in formal words.  I store it in the treasure-house of my heart.  I keep it there as a secret debt that I am glad to think I can never possibly repay.  It is embalmed and kept sweet by the myrrh and cassia of many tears.  When wisdom has been profitless to me, philosophy barren, and the proverbs and phrases of those who have sought to give me consolation as dust and ashes in my mouth, the memory of that little, lovely, silent act of love has unsealed for me all the wells of pity: made the desert blossom like a rose, and brought me out of the bitterness of lonely exile into harmony with the wounded, broken, and great heart of the world.  When people are able to understand, not merely how beautiful ---‚Äôs action was, but why it meant so much to me, and always will mean so much, then, perhaps, they will realise how and in what spirit they should approach me. . . .

The poor are wise, more charitable, more kind, more sensitive than we are.  In their eyes prison is a tragedy in a man‚Äôs life, a misfortune, a casuality, something that calls for sympathy in others.  They speak of one who is in prison as of one who is ‚Äòin trouble‚Äô simply.  It is the phrase they always use, and the expression has the perfect wisdom of love in it.  With people of our own rank it is different.  With us, prison makes a man a pariah.  I, and such as I am, have hardly any right to air and sun.  Our presence taints the pleasures of others.  We are unwelcome when we reappear.  To revisit the glimpses of the moon is not for us.  Our very children are taken away.  Those lovely links with humanity are broken.  We are doomed to be solitary, while our sons still live. We are denied the one thing that might heal us and keep us, that might bring balm to the bruised heart, and peace to the soul in pain . . . .

I must say to myself that I ruined myself, and that nobody great or small can be ruined except by his own hand.  I am quite ready to say so.  I am trying to say so, though they may not think it at the present moment.  This pitiless indictment I bring without pity against myself.  Terrible as was what the world did to me, what I did to myself was far more terrible still.

I was a man who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age.  I had realised this for myself at the very dawn of my manhood, and had forced my age to realise it afterwards.  Few men hold such a position in their own lifetime, and have it so acknowledged.  It is usually discerned, if discerned at all, by the historian, or the critic, long after both the man and his age have passed away.  With me it was different.  I felt it myself, and made others feel it.  Byron was a symbolic figure, but his relations were to the passion of his age and its weariness of passion.  Mine were to something more noble, more permanent, of more vital issue, of larger scope.

The gods had given me almost everything.  But I let myself be lured into long spells of senseless and sensual ease.  I amused myself with being a fl√¢neur, a dandy, a man of fashion.  I surrounded myself with the smaller natures and the meaner minds.  I became the spendthrift of my own genius, and to waste an eternal youth gave me a curious joy.  Tired of being on the heights, I deliberately went to the depths in the search for new sensation.  What the paradox was to me in the sphere of thought, perversity became to me in the sphere of passion.  Desire, at the end, was a malady, or a madness, or both.  I grew careless of the lives of others.  I took pleasure where it pleased me, and passed on.  I forgot that every little action of the common day makes or unmakes character, and that therefore what one has done in the secret chamber one has some day to cry aloud on the housetop.  I ceased to be lord over myself.  I was no longer the captain of my soul, and did not know it.  I allowed pleasure to dominate me.  I ended in horrible disgrace.  There is only one thing for me now, absolute humility.

I have lain in prison for nearly two years.  Out of my nature has come wild despair; an abandonment to grief that was piteous even to look at; terrible and impotent rage; bitterness and scorn; anguish that wept aloud; misery that could find no voice; sorrow that was dumb.  I have passed through every possible mood of suffering.  Better than Wordsworth himself I know what Wordsworth meant when he said‚Äî

‚ÄòSuffering is permanent, obscure, and dark
And has the nature of infinity.‚Äô

But while there were times when I rejoiced in the idea that my sufferings were to be endless, I could not bear them to be without meaning.  Now I find hidden somewhere away in my nature something that tells me that nothing in the whole world is meaningless, and suffering least of all.  That something hidden away in my nature, like a treasure in a field, is Humility.
It is the last thing left in me, and the best: the ultimate discovery at which I have arrived, the starting-point for a fresh development.  It has come to me right out of myself, so I know that it has come at the proper time.  It could not have come before, nor later.  Had any one told me of it, I would have rejected it.  Had it been brought to me, I would have refused it.  As I found it, I want to keep it.  I must do so.  It is the one thing that has in it the elements of life, of a new life, Vita Nuova for me.  Of all things it is the strangest.  One cannot acquire it, except by surrendering everything that one has.  It is only when one has lost all things, that one knows that one possesses it.

Now I have realised that it is in me, I see quite clearly what I ought to do; in fact, must do.  And when I use such a phrase as that, I need not say that I am not alluding to any external sanction or command.  I admit none.  I am far more of an individualist than I ever was.  Nothing seems to me of the smallest value except what one gets out of oneself.  My nature is seeking a fresh mode of self-realisation.  That is all I am concerned with.  And the first thing that I have got to do is to free myself from any possible bitterness of feeling against the world.

I am completely penniless, and absolutely homeless.  Yet there are worse things in the world than that.  I am quite candid when I say that rather than go out from this prison with bitterness in my heart against the world, I would gladly and readily beg my bread from door to door.  If I got nothing from the house of the rich I would get something at the house of the poor.  Those who have much are often greedy; those who have little always share. I would not a bit mind sleeping in the cool grass in summer, and when winter came on sheltering myself by the warm close-thatched rick, or under the penthouse of a great barn, provided I had love in my heart. The external things of life seem to me now of no importance at all.  You can see to what intensity of individualism I have arrived‚Äîor am arriving rather, for the journey is long, and ‚Äòwhere I walk there are thorns.‚Äô
Of course I know that to ask alms on the highway is not to be my lot, and that if ever I lie in the cool grass at night-time it will be to write sonnets to the moon.  When I go out of prison, R--- will be waiting for me on the other side of the big iron-studded gate, and he is the symbol, not merely of his own affection, but of the affection of many others besides. I believe I am to have enough to live on for about eighteen months at any rate, so that if I may not write beautiful books, I may at least read beautiful books; and what joy can be greater?  After that, I hope to be able to recreate my creative faculty.

But were things different: had I not a friend left in the world; were there not a single house open to me in pity; had I to accept the wallet and ragged cloak of sheer penury: as long as I am free from all resentment, hardness and scorn, I would be able to face the life with much more calm and confidence than I would were my body in purple and fine linen, and the soul within me sick with hate.

And I really shall have no difficulty.  When you really want love you will find it waiting for you.

I need not say that my task does not end there.  It would be comparatively easy if it did.  There is much more before me.  I have hills far steeper to climb, valleys much darker to pass through.  And I have to get it all out of myself.  Neither religion, morality, nor reason can help me at all.

Morality does not help me.  I am a born antinomian.  I am one of those who are made for exceptions, not for laws.  But while I see that there is nothing wrong in what one does, I see that there is something wrong in what one becomes.  It is well to have learned that.

Religion does not help me.  The faith that others give to what is unseen, I give to what one can touch, and look at.  My gods dwell in temples made with hands; and within the circle of actual experience is my creed made perfect and complete: too complete, it may be, for like many or all of those who have placed their heaven in this earth, I have found in it not merely the beauty of heaven, but the horror of hell also.  When I think about religion at all, I feel as if I would like to found an order for those who cannot believe: the Confraternity of the Faithless, one might call it, where on an altar, on which no taper burned, a priest, in whose heart peace had no dwelling, might celebrate with unblessed bread and a chalice empty of wine.  Every thing to be true must become a religion.  And agnosticism should have its ritual no less than faith.  It has sown its martyrs, it should reap its saints, and praise God daily for having hidden Himself from man.  But whether it be faith or agnosticism, it must be nothing external to me.  Its symbols must be of my own creating.  Only that is spiritual which makes its own form.  If I may not find its secret within myself, I shall never find it: if I have not got it already, it will never come to me.

Reason does not help me.  It tells me that the laws under which I am convicted are wrong and unjust laws, and the system under which I have suffered a wrong and unjust system.  But, somehow, I have got to make both of these things just and right to me.  And exactly as in Art one is only concerned with what a particular thing is at a particular moment to oneself, so it is also in the ethical evolution of one‚Äôs character.  I have got to make everything that has happened to me good for me.  The plank bed, the loathsome food, the hard ropes shredded into oakum till one‚Äôs finger-tips grow dull with pain, the menial offices with which each day begins and finishes, the harsh orders that routine seems to necessitate, the dreadful dress that makes sorrow grotesque to look at, the silence, the solitude, the shame‚Äîeach and all of these things I have to transform into a spiritual experience.  There is not a single degradation of the body which I must not try and make into a spiritualising of the soul.

I want to get to the point when I shall be able to say quite simply, and without affectation that the two great turning-points in my life were when my father sent me to Oxford, and when society sent me to prison.  I will not say that prison is the best thing that could have happened to me: for that phrase would savour of too great bitterness towards myself.  I would sooner say, or hear it said of me, that I was so typical a child of my age, that in my perversity, and for that perversity‚Äôs sake, I turned the good things of my life to evil, and the evil things of my life to good.

What is said, however, by myself or by others, matters little.  The important thing, the thing that lies before me, the thing that I have to do, if the brief remainder of my days is not to be maimed, marred, and incomplete, is to absorb into my nature all that has been done to me, to make it part of me, to accept it without complaint, fear, or reluctance.  The supreme vice is shallowness.  Whatever is realised is right.

When first I was put into prison some people advised me to try and forget who I was.  It was ruinous advice.  It is only by realising what I am that I have found comfort of any kind.  Now I am advised by others to try on my release to forget that I have ever been in a prison at all.  I know that would be equally fatal.  It would mean that I would always be haunted by an intolerable sense of disgrace, and that those things that are meant for me as much as for anybody else‚Äîthe beauty of the sun and moon, the pageant of the seasons, the music of daybreak and the silence of great nights, the rain falling through the leaves, or the dew creeping over the grass and making it silver‚Äîwould all be tainted for me, and lose their healing power, and their power of communicating joy.  To regret one‚Äôs own experiences is to arrest one‚Äôs own development.  To deny one‚Äôs own experiences is to put a lie into the lips of one‚Äôs own life.  It is no less than a denial of the soul.
For just as the body absorbs things of all kinds, things common and unclean no less than those that the priest or a vision has cleansed, and converts them into swiftness or strength, into the play of beautiful muscles and the moulding of fair flesh, into the curves and colours of the hair, the lips, the eye; so the soul in its turn has its nutritive functions also, and can transform into noble moods of thought and passions of high import what in itself is base, cruel and degrading; nay, more, may find in these its most august modes of assertion, and can often reveal itself most perfectly through what was intended to desecrate or destroy.

The fact of my having been the common prisoner of a common gaol I must frankly accept, and, curious as it may seem, one of the things I shall have to teach myself is not to be ashamed of it.  I must accept it as a punishment, and if one is ashamed of having been punished, one might just as well never have been punished at all.  Of course there are many things of which I was convicted that I had not done, but then there are many things of which I was convicted that I had done, and a still greater number of things in my life for which I was never indicted at all.  And as the gods are strange, and punish us for what is good and humane in us as much as for what is evil and perverse, I must accept the fact that one is punished for the good as well as for the evil that one does.  I have no doubt that it is quite right one should be.  It helps one, or should help one, to realise both, and not to be too conceited about either.  And if I then am not ashamed of my punishment, as I hope not to be, I shall be able to think, and walk, and live with freedom.

Many men on their release carry their prison about with them into the air, and hide it as a secret disgrace in their hearts, and at length, like poor poisoned things, creep into some hole and die.  It is wretched that they should have to do so, and it is wrong, terribly wrong, of society that it should force them to do so.  Society takes upon itself the right to inflict appalling punishment on the individual, but it also has the supreme vice of shallowness, and fails to realise what it has done.  When the man‚Äôs punishment is over, it leaves him to himself; that is to say, it abandons him at the very moment when its highest duty towards him begins.  It is really ashamed of its own actions, and shuns those whom it has punished, as people shun a creditor whose debt they cannot pay, or one on whom they have inflicted an irreparable, an irremediable wrong.  I can claim on my side that if I realise what I have suffered, society should realise what it has inflicted on me; and that there should be no bitterness or hate on either side.

Of course I know that from one point of view things will be made different for me than for others; must indeed, by the very nature of the case, be made so.  The poor thieves and outcasts who are imprisoned here with me are in many respects more fortunate than I am.  The little way in grey city or green field that saw their sin is small; to find those who know nothing of what they have done they need go no further than a bird might fly between the twilight and the dawn; but for me the world is shrivelled to a handsbreadth, and everywhere I turn my name is written on the rocks in lead.  For I have come, not from obscurity into the momentary notoriety of crime, but from a sort of eternity of fame to a sort of eternity of infamy, and sometimes seem to myself to have shown, if indeed it required showing, that between the famous and the infamous there is but one step, if as much as one.

Still, in the very fact that people will recognise me wherever I go, and know all about my life, as far as its follies go, I can discern something good for me.  It will force on me the necessity of again asserting myself as an artist, and as soon as I possibly can.  If I can produce only one beautiful work of art I shall be able to rob malice of its venom, and cowardice of its sneer, and to pluck out the tongue of scorn by the roots.

And if life be, as it surely is, a problem to me, I am no less a problem to life.  People must adopt some attitude towards me, and so pass judgment, both on themselves and me.  I need not say I am not talking of particular individuals.  The only people I would care to be with now are artists and people who have suffered: those who know what beauty is, and those who know what sorrow is: nobody else interests me.  Nor am I making any demands on life.  In all that I have said I am simply concerned with my own mental attitude towards life as a whole; and I feel that not to be ashamed of having been punished is one of the first points I must attain to, for the sake of my own perfection, and because I am so imperfect.

Then I must learn how to be happy.  Once I knew it, or thought I knew it, by instinct.  It was always springtime once in my heart.  My temperament was akin to joy.  I filled my life to the very brim with pleasure, as one might fill a cup to the very brim with wine.  Now I am approaching life from a completely new standpoint, and even to conceive happiness is often extremely difficult for me.  I remember during my first term at Oxford reading in Pater‚Äôs Renaissance‚Äîthat book which has had such strange influence over my life‚Äîhow Dante places low in the Inferno those who wilfully live in sadness; and going to the college library and turning to the passage in the Divine Comedy where beneath the dreary marsh lie those who were ‚Äòsullen in the sweet air,‚Äô saying for ever and ever through their sighs‚Äî

‚ÄòTristi fummo
Nell aer dolce che dal sol s‚Äôallegra.‚Äô

I knew the church condemned accidia, but the whole idea seemed to me quite fantastic, just the sort of sin, I fancied, a priest who knew nothing about real life would invent.  Nor could I understand how Dante, who says that ‚Äòsorrow remarries us to God,‚Äô could have been so harsh to those who were enamoured of melancholy, if any such there really were.  I had no idea that some day this would become to me one of the greatest temptations of my life.

While I was in Wandsworth prison I longed to die.  It was my one desire.  When after two months in the infirmary I was transferred here, and found myself growing gradually better in physical health, I was filled with rage.  I determined to commit suicide on the very day on which I left prison. After a time that evil mood passed away, and I made up my mind to live, but to wear gloom as a king wears purple: never to smile again: to turn whatever house I entered into a house of mourning: to make my friends walk slowly in sadness with me: to teach them that melancholy is the true secret of life: to maim them with an alien sorrow: to mar them with my own pain.  Now I feel quite differently.  I see it would be both ungrateful and unkind of me to pull so long a face that when my friends came to see me they would have to make their faces still longer in order to show their sympathy; or, if I desired to entertain them, to invite them to sit down silently to bitter herbs and funeral baked meats.  I must learn how to be cheerful and happy.

The last two occasions on which I was allowed to see my friends here, I tried to be as cheerful as possible, and to show my cheerfulness, in order to make them some slight return for their trouble in coming all the way from town to see me.  It is only a slight return, I know, but it is the one, I feel certain, that pleases them most.  I saw R--- for an hour on Saturday week, and I tried to give the fullest possible expression of the delight I really felt at our meeting.  And that, in the views and ideas I am here shaping for myself, I am quite right is shown to me by the fact that now for the first time since my imprisonment I have a real desire for life.

There is before me so much to do, that I would regard it as a terrible tragedy if I died before I was allowed to complete at any rate a little of it.  I see new developments in art and life, each one of which is a fresh mode of perfection.  I long to live so that I can explore what is no less than a new world to me.  Do you want to know what this new world is?  I think you can guess what it is.  It is the world in which I have been living.  Sorrow, then, and all that it teaches one, is my new world.

I used to live entirely for pleasure.  I shunned suffering and sorrow of every kind.  I hated both.  I resolved to ignore them as far as possible: to treat them, that is to say, as modes of imperfection.  They were not part of my scheme of life.  They had no place in my philosophy.  My mother, who knew life as a whole, used often to quote to me Goethe‚Äôs lines‚Äîwritten by Carlyle in a book he had given her years ago, and translated by him, I fancy, also:‚Äî
‚ÄòWho never ate his bread in sorrow,
Who never spent the midnight hours
Weeping and waiting for the morrow,‚Äî
He knows you not, ye heavenly powers.‚Äô
They were the lines which that noble Queen of Prussia, whom Napoleon treated with such coarse brutality, used to quote in her humiliation and exile; they were the lines my mother often quoted in the troubles of her later life.  I absolutely declined to accept or admit the enormous truth hidden in them.  I could not understand it.  I remember quite well how I used to tell her that I did not want to eat my bread in sorrow, or to pass any night weeping and watching for a more bitter dawn.

I had no idea that it was one of the special things that the Fates had in store for me: that for a whole year of my life, indeed, I was to do little else.  But so has my portion been meted out to me; and during the last few months I have, after terrible difficulties and struggles, been able to comprehend some of the lessons hidden in the heart of pain.  Clergymen and people who use phrases without wisdom sometimes talk of suffering as a mystery.  It is really a revelation.  One discerns things one never discerned before.  One approaches the whole of history from a different standpoint.  What one had felt dimly, through instinct, about art, is intellectually and emotionally realised with perfect clearness of vision and absolute intensity of apprehension.

I now see that sorrow, being the supreme emotion of which man is capable, is at once the type and test of all great art.  What the artist is always looking for is the mode of existence in which soul and body are one and indivisible: in which the outward is expressive of the inward: in which form reveals.  Of such modes of existence there are not a few: youth and the arts preoccupied with youth may serve as a model for us at one moment: at another we may like to think that, in its subtlety and sensitiveness of impression, its suggestion of a spirit dwelling in external things and making its raiment of earth and air, of mist and city alike, and in its morbid sympathy of its moods, and tones, and colours, modern landscape art is realising for us pictorially what was realised in such plastic perfection by the Greeks.  Music, in which all subject is absorbed in expression and cannot be separated from it, is a complex example, and a flower or a child a simple example, of what I mean; but sorrow is the ultimate type both in life and art.

Behind joy and laughter there may be a temperament, coarse, hard and callous.  But behind sorrow there is always sorrow.  Pain, unlike pleasure, wears no mask.  Truth in art is not any correspondence between the essential idea and the accidental existence; it is not the resemblance of shape to shadow, or of the form mirrored in the crystal to the form itself; it is no echo coming from a hollow hill, any more than it is a silver well of water in the valley that shows the moon to the moon and Narcissus to Narcissus.  Truth in art is the unity of a thing with itself: the outward rendered expressive of the inward: the soul made incarnate: the body instinct with spirit.  For this reason there is no truth comparable to sorrow.  There are times when sorrow seems to me to be the only truth.  Other things may be illusions of the eye or the appetite, made to blind the one and cloy the other, but out of sorrow have the worlds been built, and at the birth of a child or a star there is pain.

More than this, there is about sorrow an intense, an extraordinary reality.  I have said of myself that I was one who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age.  There is not a single wretched man in this wretched place along with me who does not stand in symbolic relation to the very secret of life.  For the secret of life is suffering.  It is what is hidden behind everything.  When we begin to live, what is sweet is so sweet to us, and what is bitter so bitter, that we inevitably direct all our desires towards pleasures, and seek not merely for a ‚Äòmonth or twain to feed on honeycomb,‚Äô but for all our years to taste no other food, ignorant all the while that we may really be starving the soul.

I remember talking once on this subject to one of the most beautiful personalities I have ever known: a woman, whose sympathy and noble kindness to me, both before and since the tragedy of my imprisonment, have been beyond power and description; one who has really assisted me, though she does not know it, to bear the burden of my troubles more than any one else in the whole world has, and all through the mere fact of her existence, through her being what she is‚Äîpartly an ideal and partly an influence: a suggestion of what one might become as well as a real help towards becoming it; a soul that renders the common air sweet, and makes what is spiritual seem as simple and natural as sunlight or the sea: one for whom beauty and sorrow walk hand in hand, and have the same message.  On the occasion of which I am thinking I recall distinctly how I said to her that there was enough suffering in one narrow London lane to show that God did not love man, and that wherever there was any sorrow, though but that of a child, in some little garden weeping over a fault that it had or had not committed, the whole face of creation was completely marred.  I was entirely wrong.  She told me so, but I could not believe her.  I was not in the sphere in which such belief was to be attained to.  Now it seems to me that love of some kind is the only possible explanation of the extraordinary amount of suffering that there is in the world.  I cannot conceive of any other explanation.  I am convinced that there is no other, and that if the world has indeed, as I have said, been built of sorrow, it has been built by the hands of love, because in no other way could the soul of man, for whom the world was made, reach the full stature of its perfection.  Pleasure for the beautiful body, but pain for the beautiful soul.

When I say that I am convinced of these things I speak with too much pride.  Far off, like a perfect pearl, one can see the city of God.  It is so wonderful that it seems as if a child could reach it in a summer‚Äôs day.  And so a child could.  But with me and such as me it is different.  One can realise a thing in a single moment, but one loses it in the long hours that follow with leaden feet.  It is so difficult to keep ‚Äòheights that the soul is competent to gain.‚Äô  We think in eternity, but we move slowly through time; and how slowly time goes with us who lie in prison I need not tell again, nor of the weariness and despair that creep back into one‚Äôs cell, and into the cell of one‚Äôs heart, with such strange insistence that one has, as it were, to garnish and sweep one‚Äôs house for their coming, as for an unwelcome guest, or a bitter master, or a slave whose slave it is one‚Äôs chance or choice to be.

And, though at present my friends may find it a hard thing to believe, it is true none the less, that for them living in freedom and idleness and comfort it is more easy to learn the lessons of humility than it is for me, who begin the day by going down on my knees and washing the floor of my cell.  For prison life with its endless privations and restrictions makes one rebellious.  The most terrible thing about it is not that it breaks one‚Äôs heart‚Äîhearts are made to be broken‚Äîbut that it turns one‚Äôs heart to stone.  One sometimes feels that it is only with a front of brass and a lip of scorn that one can get through the day at all.  And he who is in a state of rebellion cannot receive grace, to use the phrase of which the Church is so fond‚Äîso rightly fond, I dare say‚Äîfor in life as in art the mood of rebellion closes up the channels of the soul, and shuts out the airs of heaven.  Yet I must learn these lessons here, if I am to learn them anywhere, and must be filled with joy if my feet are on the right road and my face set towards ‚Äòthe gate which is called beautiful,‚Äô though I may fall many times in the mire and often in the mist go astray.

This New Life, as through my love of Dante I like sometimes to call it, is of course no new life at all, but simply the continuance, by means of development, and evolution, of my former life.  I remember when I was at Oxford saying to one of my friends as we were strolling round Magdalen‚Äôs narrow bird-haunted walks one morning in the year before I took my degree, that I wanted to eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden of the world, and that I was going out into the world with that passion in my soul.  And so, indeed, I went out, and so I lived.  My only mistake was that I confined myself so exclusively to the trees of what seemed to me the sun-lit side of the garden, and shunned the other side for its shadow and its gloom.  Failure, disgrace, poverty, sorrow, despair, suffering, tears even, the broken words that come from lips in pain, remorse that makes one walk on thorns, conscience that condemns, self-abasement that punishes, the misery that puts ashes on its head, the anguish that chooses sack-cloth for its raiment and into its own drink puts gall:‚Äîall these were things of which I was afraid.  And as I had determined to know nothing of them, I was forced to taste each of them in turn, to feed on them, to have for a season, indeed, no other food at all.

I don‚Äôt regret for a single moment having lived for pleasure.  I did it to the full, as one should do everything that one does.  There was no pleasure I did not experience.  I threw the pearl of my soul into a cup of wine.  I went down the primrose path to the sound of flutes.  I lived on honeycomb.  But to have continued the same life would have been wrong because it would have been limiting.  I had to pass on.  The other half of the garden had its secrets for me also.  Of course all this is foreshadowed and prefigured in my books.  Some of it is in The Happy Prince, some of it in The Young King, notably in the passage where the bishop says to the kneeling boy, ‚ÄòIs not He who made misery wiser than thou art‚Äô? a phrase which when I wrote it seemed to me little more than a phrase; a great deal of it is hidden away in the note of doom that like a purple thread runs through the texture of Dorian Gray; in The Critic as Artist it is set forth in many colours; in The Soul of Man it is written down, and in letters too easy to read; it is one of the refrains whose recurring motifs make Salome so like a piece of music and bind it together as a ballad; in the prose poem of the man who from the bronze of the image of the ‚ÄòPleasure that liveth for a moment‚Äô has to make the image of the ‚ÄòSorrow that abideth for ever‚Äô it is incarnate.  It could not have been otherwise.  At every single moment of one‚Äôs life one is what one is going to be no less than what one has been.  Art is a symbol, because man is a symbol.

It is, if I can fully attain to it, the ultimate realisation of the artistic life.  For the artistic life is simply self-development.  Humility in the artist is his frank acceptance of all experiences, just as love in the artist is simply the sense of beauty that reveals to the world its body and its soul.  In Marius the Epicurean Pater seeks to reconcile the artistic life with the life of religion, in the deep, sweet, and austere sense of the word.  But Marius is little more than a spectator: an ideal spectator indeed, and one to whom it is given ‚Äòto contemplate the spectacle of life with appropriate emotions,‚Äô which Wordsworth defines as the poet‚Äôs true aim; yet a spectator merely, and perhaps a little too much occupied with the comeliness of the benches of the sanctuary to notice that it is the sanctuary of sorrow that he is gazing at.

I see a far more intimate and immediate connection between the true life of Christ and the true life of the artist; and I take a keen pleasure in the reflection that long before sorrow had made my days her own and bound me to her wheel I had written in The Soul of Man that he who would lead a Christ-like life must be entirely and absolutely himself, and had taken as my types not merely the shepherd on the hillside and the prisoner in his cell, but also the painter to whom the world is a pageant and the poet for whom the world is a song.  I remember saying once to Andr√© Gide, as we sat together in some Paris caf√©, that while meta-physics had but little real interest for me, and morality absolutely none, there was nothing that either Plato or Christ had said that could not be transferred immediately into the sphere of Art and there find its complete fulfilment.

Nor is it merely that we can discern in Christ that close union of personality with perfection which forms the real distinction between the classical and romantic movement in life, but the very basis of his nature was the same as that of the nature of the artist‚Äîan intense and flamelike imagination.  He realised in the entire sphere of human relations that imaginative sympathy which in the sphere of Art is the sole secret of creation.  He understood the leprosy of the leper, the darkness of the blind, the fierce misery of those who live for pleasure, the strange poverty of the rich. Some one wrote to me in trouble, ‚ÄòWhen you are not on your pedestal you are not interesting.‚Äô  How remote was the writer from what Matthew Arnold calls ‚Äòthe Secret of Jesus.‚Äô  Either would have taught him that whatever happens to another happens to oneself, and if you want an inscription to read at dawn and at night-time, and for pleasure or for pain, write up on the walls of your house in letters for the sun to gild and the moon to silver, ‚ÄòWhatever happens to oneself happens to another.‚Äô

Christ‚Äôs place indeed is with the poets.  His whole conception of Humanity sprang right out of the imagination and can only be realised by it.  What God was to the pantheist, man was to Him.  He was the first to conceive the divided races as a unity.  Before his time there had been gods and men, and, feeling through the mysticism of sympathy that in himself each had been made incarnate, he calls himself the Son of the one or the Son of the other, according to his mood.  More than any one else in history he wakes in us that temper of wonder to which romance always appeals.  There is still something to me almost incredible in the idea of a young Galilean peasant imagining that he could bear on his own shoulders the burden of the entire world; all that had already been done and suffered, and all that was yet to be done and suffered: the sins of Nero, of Caesar Borgia, of Alexander VI., and of him who was Emperor of Rome and Priest of the Sun: the sufferings of those whose names are legion and whose dwelling is among the tombs: oppressed nationalities, factory children, thieves, people in prison, outcasts, those who are dumb under oppression and whose silence is heard only of God; and not merely imagining this but actually achieving it, so that at the present moment all who come in contact with his personality, even though they may neither bow to his altar nor kneel before his priest, in some way find that the ugliness of their sin is taken away and the beauty of their sorrow revealed to them.

I had said of Christ that he ranks with the poets.  That is true.  Shelley and Sophocles are of his company.  But his entire life also is the most wonderful of poems.  For ‚Äòpity and terror‚Äô there is nothing in the entire cycle of Greek tragedy to touch it.  The absolute purity of the protagonist raises the entire scheme to a height of romantic art from which the sufferings of Thebes and Pelops‚Äô line are by their very horror excluded, and shows how wrong Aristotle was when he said in his treatise on the drama that it would be impossible to bear the spectacle of one blameless in pain.  Nor in √Üschylus nor Dante, those stern masters of tenderness, in Shakespeare, the most purely human of all the great artists, in the whole of Celtic myth and legend, where the loveliness of the world is shown through a mist of tears, and the life of a man is no more than the life of a flower, is there anything that, for sheer simplicity of pathos wedded and made one with sublimity of tragic effect, can be said to equal or even approach the last act of Christ‚Äôs passion.  The little supper with his companions, one of whom has already sold him for a price; the anguish in the quiet moon-lit garden; the false friend coming close to him so as to betray him with a kiss; the friend who still believed in him, and on whom as on a rock he had hoped to build a house of refuge for Man, denying him as the bird cried to the dawn; his own utter loneliness, his submission, his acceptance of everything; and along with it all such scenes as the high priest of orthodoxy rending his raiment in wrath, and the magistrate of civil justice calling for water in the vain hope of cleansing himself of that stain of innocent blood that makes him the scarlet figure of history; the coronation ceremony of sorrow, one of the most wonderful things in the whole of recorded time; the crucifixion of the Innocent One before the eyes of his mother and of the disciple whom he loved; the soldiers gambling and throwing dice for his clothes; the terrible death by which he gave the world its most eternal symbol; and his final burial in the tomb of the rich man, his body swathed in Egyptian linen with costly spices and perfumes as though he had been a king‚Äôs son.  When one contemplates all this from the point of view of art alone one cannot but be grateful that the supreme office of the Church should be the playing of the tragedy without the shedding of blood: the mystical presentation, by means of dialogue and costume and gesture even, of the Passion of her Lord; and it is always a source of pleasure and awe to me to remember that the ultimate survival of the Greek chorus, lost elsewhere to art, is to be found in the servitor answering the priest at Mass.

Yet the whole life of Christ‚Äîso entirely may sorrow and beauty be made one in their meaning and manifestation‚Äîis really an idyll, though it ends with the veil of the temple being rent, and the darkness coming over the face of the earth, and the stone rolled to the door of the sepulchre.  One always thinks of him as a young bridegroom with his companions, as indeed he somewhere describes himself; as a shepherd straying through a valley with his sheep in search of green meadow or cool stream; as a singer trying to build out of the music the walls of the City of God; or as a lover for whose love the whole world was too small.  His miracles seem to me to be as exquisite as the coming of spring, and quite as natural.  I see no difficulty at all in believing that such was the charm of his personality that his mere presence could bring peace to souls in anguish, and that those who touched his garments or his hands forgot their pain; or that as he passed by on the highway of life people who had seen nothing of life‚Äôs mystery, saw it clearly, and others who had been deaf to every voice but that of pleasure heard for the first time the voice of love and found it as ‚Äòmusical as Apollo‚Äôs lute‚Äô; or that evil passions fled at his approach, and men whose dull unimaginative lives had been but a mode of death rose as it were from the grave when he called them; or that when he taught on the hillside the multitude forgot their hunger and thirst and the cares of this world, and that to his friends who listened to him as he sat at meat the coarse food seemed delicate, and the water had the taste of good wine, and the whole house became full of the odour and sweetness of nard.

Renan in his Vie de Jesus‚Äîthat gracious fifth gospel, the gospel according to St. Thomas, one might call it‚Äîsays somewhere that Christ‚Äôs great achievement was that he made himself as much loved after his death as he had been during his lifetime.  And certainly, if his place is among the poets, he is the leader of all the lovers.  He saw that love was the first secret of the world for which the wise men had been looking, and that it was only through love that one could approach either the heart of the leper or the feet of God.

And above all, Christ is the most supreme of individualists.  Humility, like the artistic, acceptance of all experiences, is merely a mode of manifestation.  It is man‚Äôs soul that Christ is always looking for.  He calls it ‚ÄòGod‚Äôs Kingdom,‚Äô and finds it in every one.  He compares it to little things, to a tiny seed, to a handful of leaven, to a pearl.  That is because one realises one‚Äôs soul only by getting rid of all alien passions, all acquired culture, and all external possessions, be they good or evil.

I bore up against everything with some stubbornness of will and much rebellion of nature, till I had absolutely nothing left in the world but one thing.  I had lost my name, my position, my happiness, my freedom, my wealth.  I was a prisoner and a pauper.  But I still had my children left.  Suddenly they were taken away from me by the law.  It was a blow so appalling that I did not know what to do, so I flung myself on my knees, and bowed my head, and wept, and said, ‚ÄòThe body of a child is as the body of the Lord: I am not worthy of either.‚Äô  That moment seemed to save me.  I saw then that the only thing for me was to accept everything.  Since then‚Äîcurious as it will no doubt sound‚ÄîI have been happier.  It was of course my soul in its ultimate essence that I had reached.  In many ways I had been its enemy, but I found it waiting for me as a friend.  When one comes in contact with the soul it makes one simple as a child, as Christ said one should be.

It is tragic how few people ever ‚Äòpossess their souls‚Äô before they die.  ‚ÄòNothing is more rare in any man,‚Äô says Emerson, ‚Äòthan an act of his own.‚Äô  It is quite true.  Most people are other people.  Their thoughts are some one else‚Äôs opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation.  Christ was not merely the supreme individualist, but he was the first individualist in history.  People have tried to make him out an ordinary philanthropist, or ranked him as an altruist with the scientific and sentimental.  But he was really neither one nor the other.  Pity he has, of course, for the poor, for those who are shut up in prisons, for the lowly, for the wretched; but he has far more pity for the rich, for the hard hedonists, for those who waste their freedom in becoming slaves to things, for those who wear soft raiment and live in kings‚Äô houses.  Riches and pleasure seemed to him to be really greater tragedies than poverty or sorrow.  And as for altruism, who knew better than he that it is vocation not volition that determines us, and that one cannot gather grapes of thorns or figs from thistles?

To live for others as a definite self-conscious aim was not his creed.  It was not the basis of his creed.  When he says, ‚ÄòForgive your enemies,‚Äô it is not for the sake of the enemy, but for one‚Äôs own sake that he says so, and because love is more beautiful than hate.  In his own entreaty to the young man, ‚ÄòSell all that thou hast and give to the poor,‚Äô it is not of the state of the poor that he is thinking but of the soul of the young man, the soul that wealth was marring.  In his view of life he is one with the artist who knows that by the inevitable law of self-perfection, the poet must sing, and the sculptor think in bronze, and the painter make the world a mirror for his moods, as surely and as certainly as the hawthorn must blossom in spring, and the corn turn to gold at harvest-time, and the moon in her ordered wanderings change from shield to sickle, and from sickle to shield.

But while Christ did not say to men, ‚ÄòLive for others,‚Äô he pointed out that there was no difference at all between the lives of others and one‚Äôs own life.  By this means he gave to man an extended, a Titan personality.  Since his coming the history of each separate individual is, or can be made, the history of the world.  Of course, culture has intensified the personality of man.  Art has made us myriad-minded.  Those who have the artistic temperament go into exile with Dante and learn how salt is the bread of others, and how steep their stairs; they catch for a moment the serenity and calm of Goethe, and yet know but too well that Baudelaire cried to God‚Äî

‚ÄòO Seigneur, donnez moi la force et le courage
De contempler mon corps et mon coeur sans d√©go√ªt.‚Äô

Out of Shakespeare‚Äôs sonnets they draw, to their own hurt it may be, the secret of his love and make it their own; they look with new eyes on modern life, because they have listened to one of Chopin‚Äôs nocturnes, or handled Greek things, or read the story of the passion of some dead man for some dead woman whose hair was like threads of fine gold, and whose mouth was as a pomegranate.  But the sympathy of the artistic temperament is necessarily with what has found expression.  In words or in colours, in music or in marble, behind the painted masks of an √Üschylean play, or through some Sicilian shepherds‚Äô pierced and jointed reeds, the man and his message must have been revealed.

To the artist, expression is the only mode under which he can conceive life at all.  To him what is dumb is dead.  But to Christ it was not so.  With a width and wonder of imagination that fills one almost with awe, he took the entire world of the inarticulate, the voiceless world of pain, as his kingdom, and made of himself its eternal mouthpiece.  Those of whom I have spoken, who are dumb under oppression, and ‚Äòwhose silence is heard only of God,‚Äô he chose as his brothers.  He sought to become eyes to the blind, ears to the deaf, and a cry in the lips of those whose tongues had been tied.  His desire was to be to the myriads who had found no utterance a very trumpet through which they might call to heaven.  And feeling, with the artistic nature of one to whom suffering and sorrow were modes through which he could realise his conception of the beautiful, that an idea is of no value till it becomes incarnate and is made an image, he made of himself the image of the Man of Sorrows, and as such has fascinated and dominated art as no Greek god ever succeeded in doing.

For the Greek gods, in spite of the white and red of their fair fleet limbs, were not really what they appeared to be.  The curved brow of Apollo was like the sun‚Äôs disc crescent over a hill at dawn, and his feet were as the wings of the morning, but he himself had been cruel to Marsyas and had made Niobe childless.  In the steel shields of Athena‚Äôs eyes there had been no pity for Arachne; the pomp and peacocks of Hera were all that was really noble about her; and the Father of the Gods himself had been too fond of the daughters of men.  The two most deeply suggestive figures of Greek Mythology were, for religion, Demeter, an Earth Goddess, not one of the Olympians, and for art, Dionysus, the son of a mortal woman to whom the moment of his birth had proved also the moment of her death.

But Life itself from its lowliest and most humble sphere produced one far more marvellous than the mother of Proserpina or the son of Semele.  Out of the Carpenter‚Äôs shop at Nazareth had come a personality infinitely greater than any made by myth and legend, and one, strangely enough, destined to reveal to the world the mystical meaning of wine and the real beauties of the lilies of the field as none, either on Cithaeron or at Enna, had ever done.

The song of Isaiah, ‚ÄòHe is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him,‚Äô had seemed to him to prefigure himself, and in him the prophecy was fulfilled.  We must not be afraid of such a phrase.  Every single work of art is the fulfilment of a prophecy: for every work of art is the conversion of an idea into an image.  Every single human being should be the fulfilment of a prophecy: for every human being should be the realisation of some ideal, either in the mind of God or in the mind of man.  Christ found the type and fixed it, and the dream of a Virgilian poet, either at Jerusalem or at Babylon, became in the long progress of the centuries incarnate in him for whom the world was waiting.

To me one of the things in history the most to be regretted is that the Christ‚Äôs own renaissance, which has produced the Cathedral at Chartres, the Arthurian cycle of legends, the life of St. Francis of Assisi, the art of Giotto, and Dante‚Äôs Divine Comedy, was not allowed to develop on its own lines, but was interrupted and spoiled by the dreary classical Renaissance that gave us Petrarch, and Raphael‚Äôs frescoes, and Palladian architecture, and formal French tragedy, and St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, and Pope‚Äôs poetry, and everything that is made from without and by dead rules, and does not spring from within through some spirit informing it.  But wherever there is a romantic movement in art there somehow, and under some form, is Christ, or the soul of Christ.  He is in Romeo and Juliet, in the Winter‚Äôs Tale, in Proven√ßal poetry, in the Ancient Mariner, in La Belle Dame sans merci, and in Chatterton‚Äôs Ballad of Charity.

We owe to him the most diverse things and people.  Hugo‚Äôs Les Mis√©rables, Baudelaire‚Äôs Fleurs du Mal, the note of pity in Russian novels, Verlaine and Verlaine‚Äôs poems, the stained glass and tapestries and the quattro-cento work of Burne-Jones and Morris, belong to him no less than the tower of Giotto, Lancelot and Guinevere, Tannh√§user, the troubled romantic marbles of Michael Angelo, pointed architecture, and the love of children and flowers‚Äîfor both of which, indeed, in classical art there was but little place, hardly enough for them to grow or play in, but which, from the twelfth century down to our own day, have been continually making their appearances in art, under various modes and at various times, coming fitfully and wilfully, as children, as flowers, are apt to do: spring always seeming to one as if the flowers had been in hiding, and only came out into the sun because they were afraid that grown up people would grow tired of looking for them and give up the search; and the life of a child being no more than an April day on which there is both rain and sun for the narcissus.

It is the imaginative quality of Christ‚Äôs own nature that makes him this palpitating centre of romance.  The strange figures of poetic drama and ballad are made by the imagination of others, but out of his own imagination entirely did Jesus of Nazareth create himself.  The cry of Isaiah had really no more to do with his coming than the song of the nightingale has to do with the rising of the moon‚Äîno more, though perhaps no less.  He was the denial as well as the affirmation of prophecy.  For every expectation that he fulfilled there was another that he destroyed.  ‚ÄòIn all beauty,‚Äô says Bacon, ‚Äòthere is some strangeness of proportion,‚Äô and of those who are born of the spirit‚Äîof those, that is to say, who like himself are dynamic forces‚ÄîChrist says that they are like the wind that ‚Äòbloweth where it listeth, and no man can tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth.‚Äô  That is why he is so fascinating to artists.  He has all the colour elements of life: mystery, strangeness, pathos, suggestion, ecstasy, love.  He appeals to the temper of wonder, and creates that mood in which alone he can be understood.

And to me it is a joy to remember that if he is ‚Äòof imagination all compact,‚Äô the world itself is of the same substance.  I said in Dorian Gray that the great sins of the world take place in the brain: but it is in the brain that everything takes place.  We know now that we do not see with the eyes or hear with the ears.  They are really channels for the transmission, adequate or inadequate, of sense impressions.  It is in the brain that the poppy is red, that the apple is odorous, that the skylark sings.

Of late I have been studying with diligence the four prose poems about Christ.  At Christmas I managed to get hold of a Greek Testament, and every morning, after I had cleaned my cell and polished my tins, I read a little of the Gospels, a dozen verses taken by chance anywhere.  It is a delightful way of opening the day.  Every one, even in a turbulent, ill-disciplined life, should do the same.  Endless repetition, in and out of season, has spoiled for us the freshness, the na√Øvet√©, the simple romantic charm of the Gospels.  We hear them read far too often and far too badly, and all repetition is anti-spiritual.  When one returns to the Greek; it is like going into a garden of lilies out of some, narrow and dark house.

And to me, the pleasure is doubled by the reflection that it is extremely probable that we have the actual terms, the ipsissima verba, used by Christ.  It was always supposed that Christ talked in Aramaic.  Even Renan thought so.  But now we know that the Galilean peasants, like the Irish peasants of our own day, were bilingual, and that Greek was the ordinary language of intercourse all over Palestine, as indeed all over the Eastern world.  I never liked the idea that we knew of Christ‚Äôs own words only through a translation of a translation.  It is a delight to me to think that as far as his conversation was concerned, Charmides might have listened to him, and Socrates reasoned with him, and Plato understood him: that he really said Œµyœâ ŒµŒπŒºŒπ Œø œÄŒøŒπŒºŒ∑ŒΩ Œø Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒøœÇ, that when he thought of the lilies of the field and how they neither toil nor spin, his absolute expression was Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±yŒ±Œ∏ŒµœÑŒµ œÑŒ± Œ∫œÅŒØŒΩŒ± œÑŒøœÖ Œ±Œ≥œÅŒøœÖ œÑœâœÇ Œ±œÖŒæŒ±ŒΩŒµŒπ ŒøœÖ Œ∫ŒøœÄŒπœÖ ŒøœÖŒ¥Œµ ŒΩŒ∑Œ∏ŒµŒπ, and that his last word when he cried out ‚Äòmy life has been completed, has reached its fulfilment, has been perfected,‚Äô was exactly as St. John tells us it was: œÑŒµœÑŒ≠ŒªŒµœÉœÑŒ±Œπ‚Äîno more.

While in reading the Gospels‚Äîparticularly that of St. John himself, or whatever early Gnostic took his name and mantle‚ÄîI see the continual assertion of the imagination as the basis of all spiritual and material life, I see also that to Christ imagination was simply a form of love, and that to him love was lord in the fullest meaning of the phrase.  Some six weeks ago I was allowed by the doctor to have white bread to eat instead of the coarse black or brown bread of ordinary prison fare.  It is a great delicacy.  It will sound strange that dry bread could possibly be a delicacy to any one.  To me it is so much so that at the close of each meal I carefully eat whatever crumbs may be left on my tin plate, or have fallen on the rough towel that one uses as a cloth so as not to soil one‚Äôs table; and I do so not from hunger‚ÄîI get now quite sufficient food‚Äîbut simply in order that nothing should be wasted of what is given to me.  So one should look on love.

Christ, like all fascinating personalities, had the power of not merely saying beautiful things himself, but of making other people say beautiful things to him; and I love the story St. Mark tells us about the Greek woman, who, when as a trial of her faith he said to her that he could not give her the bread of the children of Israel, answered him that the little dogs‚Äî(Œ∫œÖŒΩŒ±œÅŒπŒ±, ‚Äòlittle dogs‚Äô it should be rendered)‚Äîwho are under the table eat of the crumbs that the children let fall.  Most people live for love and admiration.  But it is by love and admiration that we should live.  If any love is shown us we should recognise that we are quite unworthy of it.  Nobody is worthy to be loved.  The fact that God loves man shows us that in the divine order of ideal things it is written that eternal love is to be given to what is eternally unworthy.  Or if that phrase seems to be a bitter one to bear, let us say that every one is worthy of love, except him who thinks that he is. Love is a sacrament that should be taken kneeling, and Domine, non sum dignus should be on the lips and in the hearts of those who receive it.

If ever I write again, in the sense of producing artistic work, there are just two subjects on which and through which I desire to express myself: one is ‚ÄòChrist as the precursor of the romantic movement in life‚Äô: the other is ‚ÄòThe artistic life considered in its relation to conduct.‚Äô  The first is, of course, intensely fascinating, for I see in Christ not merely the essentials of the supreme romantic type, but all the accidents, the wilfulnesses even, of the romantic temperament also.  He was the first person who ever said to people that they should live ‚Äòflower-like lives.‚Äô  He fixed the phrase.  He took children as the type of what people should try to become.  He held them up as examples to their elders, which I myself have always thought the chief use of children, if what is perfect should have a use.  Dante describes the soul of a man as coming from the hand of God ‚Äòweeping and laughing like a little child,‚Äô and Christ also saw that the soul of each one should be a guisa di fanciulla che piangendo e ridendo pargoleggia.  He felt that life was changeful, fluid, active, and that to allow it to be stereotyped into any form was death.  He saw that people should not be too serious over material, common interests: that to be unpractical was to be a great thing: that one should not bother too much over affairs.  The birds didn‚Äôt, why should man?  He is charming when he says, ‚ÄòTake no thought for the morrow; is not the soul more than meat? is not the body more than raiment?‚Äô  A Greek might have used the latter phrase.  It is full of Greek feeling.  But only Christ could have said both, and so summed up life perfectly for us.

His morality is all sympathy, just what morality should be.  If the only thing that he ever said had been, ‚ÄòHer sins are forgiven her because she loved much,‚Äô it would have been worth while dying to have said it.  His justice is all poetical justice, exactly what justice should be.  The beggar goes to heaven because he has been unhappy.  I cannot conceive a better reason for his being sent there.  The people who work for an hour in the vineyard in the cool of the evening receive just as much reward as those who have toiled there all day long in the hot sun.  Why shouldn‚Äôt they?  Probably no one deserved anything.  Or perhaps they were a different kind of people.  Christ had no patience with the dull lifeless mechanical systems that treat people as if they were things, and so treat everybody alike: for him there were no laws: there were exceptions merely, as if anybody, or anything, for that matter, was like aught else in the world!

That which is the very keynote of romantic art was to him the proper basis of natural life.  He saw no other basis.  And when they brought him one, taken in the very act of sin and showed him her sentence written in the law, and asked him what was to be done, he wrote with his finger on the ground as though he did not hear them, and finally, when they pressed him again, looked up and said, ‚ÄòLet him of you who has never sinned be the first to throw the stone at her.‚Äô  It was worth while living to have said that.

Like all poetical natures he loved ignorant people.  He knew that in the soul of one who is ignorant there is always room for a great idea.  But he could not stand stupid people, especially those who are made stupid by education: people who are full of opinions not one of which they even understand, a peculiarly modern type, summed up by Christ when he describes it as the type of one who has the key of knowledge, cannot use it himself, and does not allow other people to use it, though it may be made to open the gate of God‚Äôs Kingdom.  His chief war was against the Philistines.  That is the war every child of light has to wage.  Philistinism was the note of the age and community in which he lived.  In their heavy inaccessibility to ideas, their dull respectability, their tedious orthodoxy, their worship of vulgar success, their entire preoccupation with the gross materialistic side of life, and their ridiculous estimate of themselves and their importance, the Jews of Jerusalem in Christ‚Äôs day were the exact counterpart of the British Philistine of our own.  Christ mocked at the ‚Äòwhited sepulchre‚Äô of respectability, and fixed that phrase for ever.  He treated worldly success as a thing absolutely to be despised.  He saw nothing in it at all.  He looked on wealth as an encumbrance to a man.  He would not hear of life being sacrificed to any system of thought or morals.  He pointed out that forms and ceremonies were made for man, not man for forms and ceremonies.  He took sabbatarianism as a type of the things that should be set at nought.  The cold philanthropies, the ostentatious public charities, the tedious formalisms so dear to the middle-class mind, he exposed with utter and relentless scorn.  To us, what is termed orthodoxy is merely a facile unintelligent acquiescence; but to them, and in their hands, it was a terrible and paralysing tyranny.  Christ swept it aside.  He showed that the spirit alone was of value.  He took a keen pleasure in pointing out to them that though they were always reading the law and the prophets, they had not really the smallest idea of what either of them meant.  In opposition to their tithing of each separate day into the fixed routine of prescribed duties, as they tithe mint and rue, he preached the enormous importance of living completely for the moment.

Those whom he saved from their sins are saved simply for beautiful moments in their lives.  Mary Magdalen, when she sees Christ, breaks the rich vase of alabaster that one of her seven lovers had given her, and spills the odorous spices over his tired dusty feet, and for that one moment‚Äôs sake sits for ever with Ruth and Beatrice in the tresses of the snow-white rose of Paradise.  All that Christ says to us by the way of a little warning is that every moment should be beautiful, that the soul should always be ready for the coming of the bridegroom, always waiting for the voice of the lover, Philistinism being simply that side of man‚Äôs nature that is not illumined by the imagination.  He sees all the lovely influences of life as modes of light: the imagination itself is the world of light.  The world is made by it, and yet the world cannot understand it: that is because the imagination is simply a manifestation of love, and it is love and the capacity for it that distinguishes one human being from another.

But it is when he deals with a sinner that Christ is most romantic, in the sense of most real.  The world had always loved the saint as being the nearest possible approach to the perfection of God.  Christ, through some divine instinct in him, seems to have always loved the sinner as being the nearest possible approach to the perfection of man.  His primary desire was not to reform people, any more than his primary desire was to a relieve suffering.  To turn an interesting thief into a tedious honest man was not his aim.  He would have thought little of the Prisoners‚Äô Aid Society and other modern movements of the kind.  The conversion of a publican into a Pharisee would not have seemed to him a great achievement.  But in a manner not yet understood of the world he regarded sin and suffering as being in themselves beautiful holy things and modes of perfection.

It seems a very dangerous idea.  It is‚Äîall great ideas are dangerous.  That it was Christ‚Äôs creed admits of no doubt.  That it is the true creed I don‚Äôt doubt myself.

Of course the sinner must repent.  But why?  Simply because otherwise he would be unable to realise what he had done.  The moment of repentance is the moment of initiation.  More than that: it is the means by which one alters one‚Äôs past.  The Greeks thought that impossible.  They often say in their Gnomic aphorisms, ‚ÄòEven the Gods cannot alter the past.‚Äô  Christ showed that the commonest sinner could do it, that it was the one thing he could do.  Christ, had he been asked, would have said‚ÄîI feel quite certain about it‚Äîthat the moment the prodigal son fell on his knees and wept, he made his having wasted his substance with harlots, his swine-herding and hungering for the husks they ate, beautiful and holy moments in his life.  It is difficult for most people to grasp the idea.  I dare say one has to go to prison to understand it.  If so, it may be worth while going to prison.

There is something so unique about Christ.  Of course just as there are false dawns before the dawn itself, and winter days so full of sudden sunlight that they will cheat the wise crocus into squandering its gold before its time, and make some foolish bird call to its mate to build on barren boughs, so there were Christians before Christ.  For that we should be grateful.  The unfortunate thing is that there have been none since.  I make one exception, St. Francis of Assisi.  But then God had given him at his birth the soul of a poet, as he himself when quite young had in mystical marriage taken poverty as his bride: and with the soul of a poet and the body of a beggar he found the way to perfection not difficult.  He understood Christ, and so he became like him.  We do not require the Liber Conformitatum to teach us that the life of St. Francis was the true Imitatio Christi, a poem compared to which the book of that name is merely prose.

Indeed, that is the charm about Christ, when all is said: he is just like a work of art.  He does not really teach one anything, but by being brought into his presence one becomes something.  And everybody is predestined to his presence.  Once at least in his life each man walks with Christ to Emmaus.

As regards the other subject, the Relation of the Artistic Life to Conduct, it will no doubt seem strange to you that I should select it.  People point to Reading Gaol and say, ‚ÄòThat is where the artistic life leads a man.‚Äô  Well, it might lead to worse places.  The more mechanical people to whom life is a shrewd speculation depending on a careful calculation of ways and means, always know where they are going, and go there.  They start with the ideal desire of being the parish beadle, and in whatever sphere they are placed they succeed in being the parish beadle and no more.  A man whose desire is to be something separate from himself, to be a member of Parliament, or a successful grocer, or a prominent solicitor, or a judge, or something equally tedious, invariably succeeds in being what he wants to be.  That is his punishment.  Those who want a mask have to wear it.

But with the dynamic forces of life, and those in whom those dynamic forces become incarnate, it is different.  People whose desire is solely for self-realisation never know where they are going.  They can‚Äôt know.  In one sense of the word it is of course necessary, as the Greek oracle said, to know oneself: that is the first achievement of knowledge.  But to recognise that the soul of a man is unknowable, is the ultimate achievement of wisdom.  The final mystery is oneself.  When one has weighed the sun in the balance, and measured the steps of the moon, and mapped out the seven heavens star by star, there still remains oneself.  Who can calculate the orbit of his own soul?  When the son went out to look for his father‚Äôs asses, he did not know that a man of God was waiting for him with the very chrism of coronation, and that his own soul was already the soul of a king.

I hope to live long enough and to produce work of such a character that I shall be able at the end of my days to say, ‚ÄòYes! this is just where the artistic life leads a man!‚Äô  Two of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience are the lives of Verlaine and of Prince Kropotkin: both of them men who have passed years in prison: the first, the one Christian poet since Dante; the other, a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ which seems coming out of Russia.  And for the last seven or eight months, in spite of a succession of great troubles reaching me from the outside world almost without intermission, I have been placed in direct contact with a new spirit working in this prison through man and things, that has helped me beyond any possibility of expression in words: so that while for the first year of my imprisonment I did nothing else, and can remember doing nothing else, but wring my hands in impotent despair, and say, ‚ÄòWhat an ending, what an appalling ending!‚Äô now I try to say to myself, and sometimes when I am not torturing myself do really and sincerely say, ‚ÄòWhat a beginning, what a wonderful beginning!‚Äô  It may really be so.  It may become so.  If it does I shall owe much to this new personality that has altered every man‚Äôs life in this place.

You may realise it when I say that had I been released last May, as I tried to be, I would have left this place loathing it and every official in it with a bitterness of hatred that would have poisoned my life.  I have had a year longer of imprisonment, but humanity has been in the prison along with us all, and now when I go out I shall always remember great kindnesses that I have received here from almost everybody, and on the day of my release I shall give many thanks to many people, and ask to be remembered by them in turn.

The prison style is absolutely and entirely wrong.  I would give anything to be able to alter it when I go out.  I intend to try.  But there is nothing in the world so wrong but that the spirit of humanity, which is the spirit of love, the spirit of the Christ who is not in churches, may make it, if not right, at least possible to be borne without too much bitterness of heart.

I know also that much is waiting for me outside that is very delightful, from what St. Francis of Assisi calls ‚Äòmy brother the wind, and my sister the rain,‚Äô lovely things both of them, down to the shop-windows and sunsets of great cities.  If I made a list of all that still remains to me, I don‚Äôt know where I should stop: for, indeed, God made the world just as much for me as for any one else.  Perhaps I may go out with something that I had not got before.  I need not tell you that to me reformations in morals are as meaningless and vulgar as Reformations in theology.  But while to propose to be a better man is a piece of unscientific cant, to have become a deeper man is the privilege of those who have suffered.  And such I think I have become.

If after I am free a friend of mine gave a feast, and did not invite me to it, I should not mind a bit.  I can be perfectly happy by myself.  With freedom, flowers, books, and the moon, who could not be perfectly happy?  Besides, feasts are not for me any more.  I have given too many to care about them.  That side of life is over for me, very fortunately, I dare say.  But if after I am free a friend of mine had a sorrow and refused to allow me to share it, I should feel it most bitterly.  If he shut the doors of the house of mourning against me, I would come back again and again and beg to be admitted, so that I might share in what I was entitled to share in.  If he thought me unworthy, unfit to weep with him, I should feel it as the most poignant humiliation, as the most terrible mode in which disgrace could be inflicted on me.  But that could not be.  I have a right to share in sorrow, and he who can look at the loveliness of the world and share its sorrow, and realise something of the wonder of both, is in immediate contact with divine things, and has got as near to God‚Äôs secret as any one can get.

Perhaps there may come into my art also, no less than into my life, a still deeper note, one of greater unity of passion, and directness of impulse.  Not width but intensity is the true aim of modern art.  We are no longer in art concerned with the type.  It is with the exception that we have to do.  I cannot put my sufferings into any form they took, I need hardly say.  Art only begins where Imitation ends, but something must come into my work, of fuller memory of words perhaps, of richer cadences, of more curious effects, of simpler architectural order, of some aesthetic quality at any rate.

When Marsyas was ‚Äòtorn from the scabbard of his limbs‚Äô‚Äîdella vagina della membre sue, to use one of Dante‚Äôs most terrible Tacitean phrases‚Äîhe had no more song, the Greek said.  Apollo had been victor.  The lyre had vanquished the reed.  But perhaps the Greeks were mistaken.  I hear in much modern Art the cry of Marsyas.  It is bitter in Baudelaire, sweet and plaintive in Lamartine, mystic in Verlaine.  It is in the deferred resolutions of Chopin‚Äôs music.  It is in the discontent that haunts Burne-Jones‚Äôs women.  Even Matthew Arnold, whose song of Callicles tells of ‚Äòthe triumph of the sweet persuasive lyre,‚Äô and the ‚Äòfamous final victory,‚Äô in such a clear note of lyrical beauty, has not a little of it; in the troubled undertone of doubt and distress that haunts his verses, neither Goethe nor Wordsworth could help him, though he followed each in turn, and when he seeks to mourn for Thyrsis or to sing of the Scholar Gipsy, it is the reed that he has to take for the rendering of his strain.  But whether or not the Phrygian Faun was silent, I cannot be.  Expression is as necessary to me as leaf and blossoms are to the black branches of the trees that show themselves above the prison walls and are so restless in the wind.  Between my art and the world there is now a wide gulf, but between art and myself there is none.  I hope at least that there is none.

To each of us different fates are meted out.  My lot has been one of public infamy, of long imprisonment, of misery, of ruin, of disgrace, but I am not worthy of it‚Äînot yet, at any rate.  I remember that I used to say that I thought I could bear a real tragedy if it came to me with purple pall and a mask of noble sorrow, but that the dreadful thing about modernity was that it put tragedy into the raiment of comedy, so that the great realities seemed commonplace or grotesque or lacking in style.  It is quite true about modernity.  It has probably always been true about actual life.  It is said that all martyrdoms seemed mean to the looker on.  The nineteenth century is no exception to the rule.

Everything about my tragedy has been hideous, mean, repellent, lacking in style; our very dress makes us grotesque.  We are the zanies of sorrow.  We are clowns whose hearts are broken.  We are specially designed to appeal to the sense of humour.  On November 13th, 1895, I was brought down here from London.  From two o‚Äôclock till half-past two on that day I had to stand on the centre platform of Clapham Junction in convict dress, and handcuffed, for the world to look at.  I had been taken out of the hospital ward without a moment‚Äôs notice being given to me.  Of all possible objects I was the most grotesque.  When people saw me they laughed.  Each train as it came up swelled the audience.  Nothing could exceed their amusement.  That was, of course, before they knew who I was.  As soon as they had been informed they laughed still more.  For half an hour I stood there in the grey November rain surrounded by a jeering mob.

For a year after that was done to me I wept every day at the same hour and for the same space of time.  That is not such a tragic thing as possibly it sounds to you.  To those who are in prison tears are a part of every day‚Äôs experience.  A day in prison on which one does not weep is a day on which one‚Äôs heart is hard, not a day on which one‚Äôs heart is happy.

Well, now I am really beginning to feel more regret for the people who laughed than for myself.  Of course when they saw me I was not on my pedestal, I was in the pillory.  But it is a very unimaginative nature that only cares for people on their pedestals.  A pedestal may be a very unreal thing.  A pillory is a terrific reality.  They should have known also how to interpret sorrow better.  I have said that behind sorrow there is always sorrow.  It were wiser still to say that behind sorrow there is always a soul.  And to mock at a soul in pain is a dreadful thing.  In the strangely simple economy of the world people only get what they give, and to those who have not enough imagination to penetrate the mere outward of things, and feel pity, what pity can be given save that of scorn?

I write this account of the mode of my being transferred here simply that it should be realised how hard it has been for me to get anything out of my punishment but bitterness and despair.  I have, however, to do it, and now and then I have moments of submission and acceptance.  All the spring may be hidden in the single bud, and the low ground nest of the lark may hold the joy that is to herald the feet of many rose-red dawns.  So perhaps whatever beauty of life still remains to me is contained in some moment of surrender, abasement, and humiliation.  I can, at any rate, merely proceed on the lines of my own development, and, accepting all that has happened to me, make myself worthy of it.

People used to say of me that I was too individualistic.  I must be far more of an individualist than ever I was.  I must get far more out of myself than ever I got, and ask far less of the world than ever I asked.  Indeed, my ruin came not from too great individualism of life, but from too little.  The one disgraceful, unpardonable, and to all time contemptible action of my life was to allow myself to appeal to society for help and protection.  To have made such an appeal would have been from the individualist point of view bad enough, but what excuse can there ever be put forward for having made it?  Of course once I had put into motion the forces of society, society turned on me and said, ‚ÄòHave you been living all this time in defiance of my laws, and do you now appeal to those laws for protection?  You shall have those laws exercised to the full.  You shall abide by what you have appealed to.‚Äô  The result is I am in gaol.  Certainly no man ever fell so ignobly, and by such ignoble instruments, as I did.

The Philistine element in life is not the failure to understand art.  Charming people, such as fishermen, shepherds, ploughboys, peasants and the like, know nothing about art, and are the very salt of the earth.  He is the Philistine who upholds and aids the heavy, cumbrous, blind, mechanical forces of society, and who does not recognise dynamic force when he meets it either in a man or a movement.

People thought it dreadful of me to have entertained at dinner the evil things of life, and to have found pleasure in their company.  But then, from the point of view through which I, as an artist in life, approach them they were delightfully suggestive and stimulating.  The danger was half the excitement. . . . My business as an artist was with Ariel.  I set myself to wrestle with Caliban. . . .

A great friend of mine‚Äîa friend of ten years‚Äô standing‚Äîcame to see me some time ago, and told me that he did not believe a single word of what was said against me, and wished me to know that he considered me quite innocent, and the victim of a hideous plot.  I burst into tears at what he said, and told him that while there was much amongst the definite charges that was quite untrue and transferred to me by revolting malice, still that my life had been full of perverse pleasures, and that unless he accepted that as a fact about me and realised it to the full I could not possibly be friends with him any more, or ever be in his company.  It was a terrible shock to him, but we are friends, and I have not got his friendship on false pretences.

Emotional forces, as I say somewhere in Intentions, are as limited in extent and duration as the forces of physical energy.  The little cup that is made to hold so much can hold so much and no more, though all the purple vats of Burgundy be filled with wine to the brim, and the treaders stand knee-deep in the gathered grapes of the stony vineyards of Spain.  There is no error more common than that of thinking that those who are the causes or occasions of great tragedies share in the feelings suitable to the tragic mood: no error more fatal than expecting it of them.  The martyr in his ‚Äòshirt of flame‚Äô may be looking on the face of God, but to him who is piling the faggots or loosening the logs for the blast the whole scene is no more than the slaying of an ox is to the butcher, or the felling of a tree to the charcoal burner in the forest, or the fall of a flower to one who is mowing down the grass with a scythe.  Great passions are for the great of soul, and great events can be seen only by those who are on a level with them.

I know of nothing in all drama more incomparable from the point of view of art, nothing more suggestive in its subtlety of observation, than Shakespeare‚Äôs drawing of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.  They are Hamlet‚Äôs college friends.  They have been his companions.  They bring with them memories of pleasant days together.  At the moment when they come across him in the play he is staggering under the weight of a burden intolerable to one of his temperament.  The dead have come armed out of the grave to impose on him a mission at once too great and too mean for him.  He is a dreamer, and he is called upon to act.  He has the nature of the poet, and he is asked to grapple with the common complexity of cause and effect, with life in its practical realisation, of which he knows nothing, not with life in its ideal essence, of which he knows so much.  He has no conception of what to do, and his folly is to feign folly.  Brutus used madness as a cloak to conceal the sword of his purpose, the dagger of his will, but the Hamlet madness is a mere mask for the hiding of weakness.  In the making of fancies and jests he sees a chance of delay.  He keeps playing with action as an artist plays with a theory.  He makes himself the spy of his proper actions, and listening to his own words knows them to be but ‚Äòwords, words, words.‚Äô  Instead of trying to be the hero of his own history, he seeks to be the spectator of his own tragedy.  He disbelieves in everything, including himself, and yet his doubt helps him not, as it comes not from scepticism but from a divided will.

Of all this Guildenstern and Rosencrantz realise nothing.  They bow and smirk and smile, and what the one says the other echoes with sickliest intonation.  When, at last, by means of the play within the play, and the puppets in their dalliance, Hamlet ‚Äòcatches the conscience‚Äô of the King, and drives the wretched man in terror from his throne, Guildenstern and Rosencrantz see no more in his conduct than a rather painful breach of Court etiquette.  That is as far as they can attain to in ‚Äòthe contemplation of the spectacle of life with appropriate emotions.‚Äô  They are close to his very secret and know nothing of it.  Nor would there be any use in telling them.  They are the little cups that can hold so much and no more.  Towards the close it is suggested that, caught in a cunning spring set for another, they have met, or may meet, with a violent and sudden death.  But a tragic ending of this kind, though touched by Hamlet‚Äôs humour with something of the surprise and justice of comedy, is really not for such as they.  They never die.  Horatio, who in order to ‚Äòreport Hamlet and his cause aright to the unsatisfied,‚Äô

‚ÄòAbsents him from felicity a while,
And in this harsh world draws his breath in pain,‚Äô

dies, but Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are as immortal as Angelo and Tartuffe, and should rank with them.  They are what modern life has contributed to the antique ideal of friendship.  He who writes a new De Amicitia must find a niche for them, and praise them in Tusculan prose.  They are types fixed for all time.  To censure them would show ‚Äòa lack of appreciation.‚Äô  They are merely out of their sphere: that is all.  In sublimity of soul there is no contagion.  High thoughts and high emotions are by their very existence isolated.

* * * * *

I am to be released, if all goes well with me, towards the end of May, and hope to go at once to some little sea-side village abroad with R--- and M---.

The sea, as Euripides says in one of his plays about Iphigeneia, washes away the stains and wounds of the world.

I hope to be at least a month with my friends, and to gain peace and balance, and a less troubled heart, and a sweeter mood.  I have a strange longing for the great simple primeval things, such as the sea, to me no less of a mother than the Earth.  It seems to me that we all look at Nature too much, and live with her too little.  I discern great sanity in the Greek attitude.  They never chattered about sunsets, or discussed whether the shadows on the grass were really mauve or not.  But they saw that the sea was for the swimmer, and the sand for the feet of the runner.  They loved the trees for the shadow that they cast, and the forest for its silence at noon.  The vineyard-dresser wreathed his hair with ivy that he might keep off the rays of the sun as he stooped over the young shoots, and for the artist and the athlete, the two types that Greece gave us, they plaited with garlands the leaves of the bitter laurel and of the wild parsley, which else had been of no service to men.

We call ours a utilitarian age, and we do not know the uses of any single thing.  We have forgotten that water can cleanse, and fire purify, and that the Earth is mother to us all.  As a consequence our art is of the moon and plays with shadows, while Greek art is of the sun and deals directly with things.  I feel sure that in elemental forces there is purification, and I want to go back to them and live in their presence.

Of course to one so modern as I am, ‚ÄòEnfant de mon si√®cle,‚Äô merely to look at the world will be always lovely.  I tremble with pleasure when I think that on the very day of my leaving prison both the laburnum and the lilac will be blooming in the gardens, and that I shall see the wind stir into restless beauty the swaying gold of the one, and make the other toss the pale purple of its plumes, so that all the air shall be Arabia for me.  Linnaeus fell on his knees and wept for joy when he saw for the first time the long heath of some English upland made yellow with the tawny aromatic brooms of the common furze; and I know that for me, to whom flowers are part of desire, there are tears waiting in the petals of some rose.  It has always been so with me from my boyhood.  There is not a single colour hidden away in the chalice of a flower, or the curve of a shell, to which, by some subtle sympathy with the very soul of things, my nature does not answer.  Like Gautier, I have always been one of those ‚Äòpour qui le monde visible existe.‚Äô

Still, I am conscious now that behind all this beauty, satisfying though it may be, there is some spirit hidden of which the painted forms and shapes are but modes of manifestation, and it is with this spirit that I desire to become in harmony.  I have grown tired of the articulate utterances of men and things.  The Mystical in Art, the Mystical in Life, the Mystical in Nature this is what I am looking for.  It is absolutely necessary for me to find it somewhere.

All trials are trials for one‚Äôs life, just as all sentences are sentences of death; and three times have I been tried.  The first time I left the box to be arrested, the second time to be led back to the house of detention, the third time to pass into a prison for two years.  Society, as we have constituted it, will have no place for me, has none to offer; but Nature, whose sweet rains fall on unjust and just alike, will have clefts in the rocks where I may hide, and secret valleys in whose silence I may weep undisturbed.  She will hang the night with stars so that I may walk abroad in the darkness without stumbling, and send the wind over my footprints so that none may track me to my hurt: she will cleanse me in great waters, and with bitter herbs make me whole.5Embed","Although my friends might find it difficult to accept right now, it is nonetheless true that it is easier for them to grasp the lessons of humility while living in freedom, leisure, and comfort than it is for me, who is just starting out.

459,Tennessee Orange,Megan Moroney,Tennessee Orange,78,"12 ContributorsTennessee Orange Lyrics[Verse 1]
Mama, I'm callin', I've got some news
Don't you tell Daddy, he'll blow a fuse
Don't worry, I'm doin' okay
I know you raised me to know right from wrong
It ain't what you think and I'm still writin' songs
Just never thought I'd see the day
I've never felt this way

[Chorus]
I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia, they'd call it a sin
I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him

[Verse 2]
Took me to Knoxville last Saturday
And I wore the hat on his dash to the game
It sure wasn't Athens, but I
Fell for him under those Neyland lights

[Chorus]
I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia, they'd call it a sin
I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him

Mama, forgive me, I like him a lot
Hell, I'm learnin' the words to ""Old Rocky Top""
He's got a smile that makes me forget
I've always looked better in red

But I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia, they'd call it a sin
And I still want the Dawgs to win
But I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him

1 ContributorTennessee Orange Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, it's been a while since I've seen that truck out on the highway
Sittin' all alone at the light, I can see it from the window
And I wonder if that boy ever thinks of me
And what I'd be doin' if he ever comes back around

[Chorus]
I'd be out on the porch, he'd be out on the stoop
We'd be sippin' Tennessee Orange, and we'd be sittin' on the roof

[Verse 2]
I'd be singin' in the choir, he'd be singin' in the band
We'd be in the same old place we always were
I'd be holdin' his hand, he'd be holdin' my hand
And I'd never let go, I'd never let go

[Chorus]
I'd be out on the porch, he'd be out on the stoop
We'd be sippin' Tennessee Orange, and we'd be sittin' on the roof

I'll touch that fire for you
I do that three, four times again, I testify for you
I told that lie, I'd kill that bitch
I do what all of them around you scared to do, I'm not
Long as you juggin' out here for me, I got it
Mobbin', schemin', lootin', hide your bodies
Long as you dreamin' 'bout me, ain't no problem
I don't got nobody, just with you right now
Tell the truth, I look better under you

[Chorus]
I can't lose when I'm with you
How can I snooze and miss the moment?
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do
I can't lose when I'm with you
I can't just snooze and miss the moment
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do, you do

In a droptop ride with you, I feel like Scarface (Scarface)
Like that white bitch with the bob, I'll be your main one (Your main one)

You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around

[Pre-Chorus]
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

[Chorus]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

[Verse 2]
Spiderboy, king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
It's coming back around

Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

[Bridge]
Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
(I'm still here, I'm still here)

[Breakdown]
'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma's gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me
[Chorus]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Karma is my boyfriend)
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend)

Aren't you envious that for you it's not?

I'm in the bathroom, looking in the mirror
Saying to myself, ""What the fuck?""
I'm so confused, and I don't know what to do
So I do it again

I don't know what's right, but I try
Try, try, try, try

You swear that you're stayin' single, next thing you know
You meet a girl at a bar and next thing you know
You get her laughin', it's 2AM
You're tellin' your buddies, three months in
That she ain't movin' in, the next thing you know
There's a U-Haul trailer, the next thing you know
Your old apartment, is y'all's new place
There goes the carpet but the deer head stays

[Chorus]
Next thing you know
You're savin' money like never before, just to
Spend it all at a jewelry store
Gettin' down on one knee on h–µr mama's porch
Just prayin' she don't say, ""No""
Next thing you know
Your best man giv–µs a half-drunk speech and you're
Sunburnt on a honeymoon beach and your
Left hand's gettin' used to that ring
And there the next two or three years go
Next thing you know

[Verse 2]
You weren't really tryin', next thing you know
There's a test on the counter, next thing you know
She's standin' there cryin', noddin' her head yes
You're half excited, half scared to death

'Cause next thing you know
You're wearin' scrubs and a funny white hat and the
Doctor's sayin', how you doin' there dad and
Nobody's ever called you that
And you take that drive home slow
Next thing you know
It's first steps, first dates, first car
It's 11:01 wonderin' where they are
You're sayin' that USC's too far
It's amazing how fast seventeen years go
Next thing you know
Next thing you know

[Bridge]
Next thing you know
You get to know your wife again and you're
More in love than you've ever been
With a lot of years of remember when's and still some down the road

[Chorus]
'Cause next thing you know
You got a yard full of your kid's kids
And you take 'em to church, teach 'em to fish
And you, tell 'em stories every chance you get
About how fast this life down here can go

She never wanted to be white-picket fenced in
Her heart's like a feather in a Tulsa wind
Seaside breeze'll bring her to life
And all them other boys say she's a goodbye girl
She'll wreck your world
And leave before the mornin' sun
But here she is, free, lyin' next to me
'Cause I ain't tryna tame her love

[Chorus]
I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her
Wild
Wild

[Verse 2]
Saw that highway unwind in her deep-brown eyes
She saw a long stretch of dirt road dreamin' in mine
She ain't livin' for a diamond ring
Just livin' like the rock 'n' roll song she sings out loud
We're burnin' it down
Blazin' up a trail of smoke
Wherever we are, wherever we go
Yeah, that's where she calls home

Hope you ain't lovin' the crew
How many bodies you got?
Pray it ain't more than a few
Know that you dealt with some lames
When you was young and in school
He had to pop your cherry
But I got it wet like a pool
She got a new G-Wag'
She wanna hit Highlight Room and show it off
Got a new body, girl, show it off
This a Brazilian, I know it's soft
Toned up and she got a six-pack
Look like she used to play volleyball
American Express, you can have it all
Code to the safe, you can have it all
Fuck your main pag–µ, what's your Finsta? I wanna know the real you
You started dancin' to pay your tuition, girl, I wanna know what you been through
You want a boutiqu–µ or you wanna sell hair, just let me know what you into

Four words when I think about them is crusty, musty, dusty, rusty
Eight words when I think about us is fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me
Disrespect ya and I'll smack 'em
The texts that you send in captions
The videos we got ever leak, we goin' viral or goin' platinum
Don't worry 'bout your friend's story when I had her alone
She gon' try and put some extras on it, take you out of your zone
You know how it goes when they can't get a reservation up in Carbone
They gon' tell you it's a chill night, tell you how they'd rather stay home, yeah
Jealous-ass hoes, yeah
And I know what I said 'bout bein' in Vogue
But just like that R&B group from the '90s
Girl, one call, I'll get you in Vogue
One call, you in runway shows
One call, I'm sittin' front row
One wrong call from your ex nigga sayin' dumb shit'll get him sent home
One call and my niggas ten toes
Down to go wherever I say go
Even if we gotta travel 'cross the globe
Down to take you to the end of the road, for real

I went and bought the biggest bottle they got 'cause you're gone
Drop a needle on a vinyl and cry to an old Haggard song
Sittin' at the table, baby breakin' the seal
Gonna see how much of this pain I can kill
I went and bought the biggest bottle they got 'cause you're gone

[Chorus]

'Cause you ain't here to love me
I drink now that there's nothing to lose
I've been fightin' with your memory
I hate the way it hits me
I wake up everyday black and blue
After all this back and forth, a fifth won't do
Yeah, I finally got a handle, finally got a handle on you

[Verse 2]
I tell myself that I should quit but I don't listen to drunks
I keep on sippin' 'til ""I miss you"" don't roll off my tongue
Since you poured our love down the sink
I think I'll just stay here and drink
I tell myself that I should quit but I don't listen to drunks

[Chorus]

'Cause you ain't here to love me
I drink now that there's nothing to lose

Yellow diamonds in the watch, this shit cost a lot
Never send a bitch your dot, that's how you get shot
I DM in Vanish Mode, I do that shit a lot
Took her panties off and this bitch thicker than the plot
All my exes ain't nothin', them hoes busted
If my opps ain't rappin', they ass duckin'
You ain't ready to pull the trigger, don't clutch it
I know you on your period baby, can you suck it?
I'm a savage (21)
Smack her booty in Magic (21, 21)
I'll slap a pussy nigga with a ratchet (Pussy)
I might slap a tracker on his whip and get the addy (Pussy)
Don't call me on Christmas Eve, bitch, call your daddy (21)
Bitch, call your uncle (21), bitch, don't call me (21)
Always in my ear, your ho a flea (Fuck)
Why my opps be posting guns and only use they feet? (21)
Paid like an athlete, I got‚Äî

All you hoes, all of you hoes need to remember who y'all talkin' to
It's a Slaughter Gang CEO
I got dick for you if I'm not workin', girl
If I'm busy then fuck no
You need to find you someone else to call
When your bank account get low, you need to find you someone‚Äî

[Intro: Drake]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm on that Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit, ayy

[Verse: Drake]
Sticks and stones, chrome on chrome
That's just what a nigga on
Internet clones, got 'em kissin' through the phone
Pussies cliquin' up so they don't feel alone, ayy
Nan' nigga seein' me, I'm Young Money CMB
I used to roll with CMG, the house is not a BNB
The bad bitches waitin' on a nigga like I'm PND
I'm steady pushin' P, you niggas pushing PTSD
I told her ass to kiss me in the club, fuck a TMZ
I used to want a GMC, when Woe was doing B&E
We revvin' up and goin' on a run like we DMC
I layup with her for a couple days, then its BRB
You rappers love askin' if I fucked, when you know we did
When you know we did
She came in heels but she left out on her cozy shit
Ayy, I'm livin' every twenty-four like Kobe did
Shoutout to the 6ix, R.I.P to 8
Swear this shit is gettin' ate, I'm on ten for the cake
Get a lot of love from twelve, but I don't reciprocate
Fifty-one division stay patrollin' when it's late
21 my addy, so the knife is on the gate
All the dawgs eatin' off a Baccarat plate
Niggas see Drake and they underestimate
Take it from a vet', that's a rookie ass mistake, ayy
[Outro: Drake & Young Nudy]
Ah, what, what
Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
On God
Boy, look, you the motherfuckin' man, boy, you, ooh

Sleazin' and teasin', I'm sittin' on him
All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him

[Verse 1: RAYE]
A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'

[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways
You might also like[Chorus: RAYE]
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel

[Verse 2: RAYE]
Toke this joint how I'm blowin' this steam
Back to my ways like 2019
Not twenty-four hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in

[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways
[Chorus: RAYE & 070 Shake]
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel, mm (What?)

[Verse 3: 070 Shake & RAYE]
'Cause I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
Be at peace with the things you can't change (Last night)
I'll be naked when I leave and I was naked when I came, yeah
Out of reach, out of touch
Too numb, I don't feel no way
Toast up, so what?
Street small, but it go both ways
So, you'll run, yeah
But you'll never escape
Sunset in the maze
(You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel)

[Chorus: RAYE]
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night, oh
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel
[Bridge: 070 Shake]
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night

[Outro: RAYE]
Mm, lipstick smudged like modern art
I don't know where the fuck I am or who's drivin' the fuckin' car
Speedin' down the highway, sippin'
Mixin' pills with the liquor 'cah fuck these feelings
I left everyone I love on read (Uh-huh)
Spilling secrets to the stranger in my bed (Uh-huh)
I remember nothing so there's nothing to regret (Uh-uh)

Telling myself I won't go there

Tryna wash away all the blood I've spilt
This lust is a burden that we both share
Two sinners can't atone from a lone prayer
Souls tied, intertwined by pride and guilt

From the way that I've been livin'
(Ooh) But I know I can't resist it

Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from th–µ daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight

Try to follow your light, but it's nighttime

I had to check on my man, think he part of the Klan
Keep a mask, he got too many Ks
I had to run up them bands when I got out the can
Can't go back, I got too many cases
He actin' bad on the 'Gram, but we know what's gon' happen
It happen in every occasion
Somebody killed, I be tellin' my youngins to chill
Check the stats, I do numbers, for real
And this ain't no cap, I get money, for real
That lil' boy ain't run up no commas, for real
Don't play with Baby, I go million for million
I made it out, but yet I'm still in the field
Five hundred racks sittin' in my Urus
Ten carat diamonds spent in my earlobes
Superhero Baby, savin' the ghetto
If I'm not the man, I'm the man in the middle
Hop out the car with my hand on my pistol
He just a fan and he mad I don't feel him
I know they know that I ran with them killers
Fuck it, you know I still run with them guys
Drivebys a waste of my time, I want somebody to die
I risk it all, put my sack on the line
I came from the back of the line
We had it crackin' since back when lil' one was alive
You can go ask on my line
I wish Lil Woo would've never went through with his move
But I'm glad that he through with his dime, yeah

He say that shit when I see him, then he'll see

Got the best of the best in the sheets with me
Hands down, can't nobody compete with me

I'm just waitin' on bronem to max out
Every show that I get, it be packed out
Five K for your teeth, you got ripped off
Spent a hundred thousand on mine
Crack a smile just to show the diamonds
From the corner to another continent
Got a baby daddy? I don't wanna hit
Need a Nike deal how I'm runnin' shit
He can't come to the A, he on punishment
Catch that boy out of place, we gon' punish him
Take his chain and his watch on some funny shit
Brodie ready to crash on some dummy shit
Gotta fuck me for free, ain't no money, bitch

We had twenty vibes out in Vegas

I thought by now I'd have it figured out
How not to make the easy thing so hard to do
I bet that I'd be further down this road
If I could read the signs that point me to the truth

I never planned on being nothin' but a cowboy
But somewhere I picked up this old guitar
Girl, all I can say is that I'm sorry
If I get kinda careless with your heart

Chasin' all that empty, still ain't got it right
All the crazy and the gypsy
I guess all I'm sayin' is forgive me
If I don't know what I'm doin'

I went lookin' at pictures I didn't wanna see
They brought back memories
You look happy, I guess, got the life that you wanted
But it ain't with me
You would think by now that I wouldn't care
It's been a couple years and, yeah, I've had my share
Of other broken-up hearts, but I only shed real tears over ours

[Chorus]
And now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously
And now I'm in the back of the church
Prayin' just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who was there for me
Religiously

[Verse 2]
Remember watchin' you play me our song on guitar
I thought I'd marry you
Act like I'm happier now, but all of my friends know
That ain't the truth
And lately life's been good to me
Mama's healthy and I'm helpin' out the whole family
Lotta people know my name, I made a little change

Queen

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj & Lumidee]
Only on them C's if it's breeze, Red Ruby Da Sleeze  (Uh-oh, uh-oh)
Chinese on my sleeve, these wannabe Chun-Lis
Anyway, ‰Ω†Â•Ω (‰Ω†Â•Ω, uh-oh)
Who the fuck told bitches they was me now? (Uh-oh, ooh)
I knew these bitches was slow, I ain't know these bitches senile (Ooh)
Married a shooter case you niggas tried to breathe loud (Brr-brr)
Boom your face off, then I tell him, ""Cease fire""
I'm the A, B side
Seven-hundred on them horses when we fixin' to leave (Uh-oh)
But I don't fuck with horses since Christopher Reeves (Uh-oh)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)
Gotta be careful when I dip, it's flips all in the whip
It's 40s with 30 clips, FN's with the switch
Guacamole with the taco, waitin' on El Chapo
Came in the Rolls and left low in a Tahoe

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bad gyal don't die-die-die (Brr)
Hundred rounds on that grrah-ta-ta
Real one lick a shot-ta-ta
She my lil' vibe, my lil' ah-ah-ah
Bad gyal don't run from nobody, like ah
Rude boy want me touchin' on his body, like yah
Boy affi dead if he ever diss me
And he know what to do if he ever miss me

Miss me with that na-na-na-na-na-na-na

He want the bad gyal sleeze like that
Why I'm a tease like that?
Ill, na-na-na-na-na-na-na
He told me bring him that na-na-na-na-na-na-na
We don't be Karen like Donna-na-na-na-na-na
I like it when he grab my cheeks like that (Uh)
Why I'm a freak like that?

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bad gyal don't die-die-die
Hundred rounds on that grrah-ta-ta

And he know what to do if he ever miss me

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj & Lumidee]
When the Queen leave, bitches wanna come out like a cockroach (Uh-oh, uh-oh)
Until I'm cookin' in the kitchen like a pot roast
That new Spectre, we don't feel pot holes (Uh-oh, uh-oh)
Dorito‚Äîbitches mad that they nachos
Shout out my vatos
Shout out to hoes that's watchin' me like Movados (Click, click, click)
All them, all them botched face photos, why would you post those?
Make a gyal duppy since I heard you like my ghost, hoes
Big truck but I'm alone like Post though (Uh-oh, uh-oh)
Call Malone and tell him I'm goin' postal (Brr)
These bitches rappin' like my blooper roll (Uh-oh, uh-oh)
Desert Eagle if your nigga actin' super bold
(Got 'em, got 'em, got 'em) Got 'em like, ""Uh-oh""
Gun fingers like niggas doin' the bogle
Ya fuckin' bozo
That .40 cal a make 'em dance like a go-go
Super fakks, that's word to Super Cat
We ah rude gyal youth and we nuh tek back we chat
'Cause bitches couldn't walk in my Crocs, that's word to Dundee
Just a bunch of airheads like Kelly Bundy
Man, these bitches so slow, man, they slower than sloths (Uh-oh, uh-oh)
Six-hundred horse, how you gon' catch the boss?
Caught 'em with they hand out, tryna catch the sauce (Uh-oh, uh-oh)
Thierry Mugler flow, tryna cut the cloth
See the difference is: I run businesses (Uh-oh, uh-oh)
If I ain't employ you, then what ya business is?
I'll have staff roll up, like, ""What the business is?"" (Uh-oh, uh-oh)
Oh, you don't know that my niggas kill witnesses?
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]

If I could buy a house on Memory Lane
I'd put my money down and I'd sign my name
On that little corner lot where it don't ever rain
And we'd stay good as new like a fresh coat of paint
You'd be mine in the shine of a front porch light
Yeah, I might as well live there, baby
That's where I spend most of my time

[Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights
Those tangled up mornings lost in paradise
Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes
You're pulling me closer, your head on my shoulder
We'd never let go and we'd never be over

[Verse 2]
If I could buy a house on Memory Lane
I wouldn't have to wonder if you miss me the same
I'd be loving you as usual, telling you you're beautiful
Oh, I'd be happily delusional

[Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights
Those tangled up mornings lost in paradise
Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes
You're pulling me closer, your head on my shoulder
We'd never let go and we'd never be over

When you say I love you
Before you hang up the phone
When you buy her favorite wine
On your way home
When you kiss her in the kitchen
When you kiss her on the street
When you kiss her when she‚Äôs still asleep

[Chorus]
It matters to her
It stays on her mind
When you put her first
Every single time
When you think she don‚Äôt see
When you think she don‚Äôt care
When you think she don‚Äôt notice
What you‚Äôre doing there
Every littl–µ look
Every single word
Oh it matters to h–µr

[Verse 2]
When you pull her in close
When she‚Äôs had a bad day
When you shut up and listen
To what she has to say
When you tell her she‚Äôs stronger
Than the storm blowing in

But I don't wanna go home
'Cause I know she'll be there
She'll be there

Chorus
Oh, it matters to her
That I'm still breathin'
And it matters to her
That I'm still tryin'
Oh, it matters to her
That I'm still movin'
And it matters to her
That I'm still drivin'
Same old truck

Verse 2
Yeah, it's been a long day and I'm tired of the rain
And I'm tired of the clouds, and I'm tired of the pain
I'm just tired of the way it's been lately
And I'm tired of the way I've been feelin' lately
But I don't wanna go home
'Cause I know she'll be there
She'll be there

It Matters To Her Lyrics[Verse 1]
She says she's not the type to go out drinkin'
But she likes a cold beer when it's hot
She's never been to Nashville, but she's been to Memphis
And she knows a little bit about Hank
She likes it when I talk about my daddy
And how he raised me on the farm
She knows about the good Lord and His mercy
And how He's been good to me

[Chorus]
She don't like to go out and show off
And she doesn't care about the lights
But she's never been to L.A.
And I've never been to the White House
And it doesn't matter to her
If I'm sittin' in the front or the back
It don't matter to her
If I'm sittin' in the front or the back
It don't matter to her

[Verse 2]
She's not the type to wear designer clothes
But she likes a little black dress
She's never been to Hollywood, but she's been to Nashville
And she knows a little bit about Hank
She likes it when I talk about my daddy
And how he raised me on the farm
She knows about the good Lord and His mercy
And how He's been good to me

500,I Wrote The Book,Morgan Wallen,One Thing At A Time,79,"15 ContributorsI Wrote The Book Lyrics[Verse 1]
When it comes to hitchin' the boat up
Backin' down the ramp in my old truck
To find a bunch of logs
To catch a bunch of hogs
Yeah, I wrote the book
Yeah, I wrote the book

[Verse 2]
If you wanna learn to throw a curve right
To catch a clean up lookin' on a third strike
Talk a little smack while he's walkin' back
Yeah, I wrote the book

[Chorus]
But there's one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a Jack of all trades but man I gotta say
That's one book I didn't write

[Verse 3]
I met a good girl she had her life straight
She said she loved that I was good at everythin'
One day she left me in a cloud of dust
'Cause I never was too good at pickin' up
[Chorus]
The one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
The one that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a Jack of all trades but man I gotta say
That's one book I didn't write

[Bridge]
Yeah, the good Lord knows I need it
I didn't write it but I probably oughta read it

[Chorus]
The one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line

Ayy, just thinking 'bout the way you make me feel
It's so, it's so real

[Chorus]
2 AM, the night still young
You live by the gun, you gon' die by the gun
Ain't no handouts for nobody
When I ain't had shit, they ain't offer me nothin'
When I'm quiet, I be thinking 'bout killings
A lot of niggas bitch-made, stay in they feelings
Saving these hoes, this shit here pitiful
All these lil' bitty bitches my chillens, ooh
And Mama, don't worry
You raised a gangster, I'm a survivor
It hurt me
Not being able to give you what you want since I was a toddler
Shout out to my pops for all the free game
Everything you ev–µr told me, it stuck in my brain
Real OG status and like to mak–µ a change
Shedded tears writin' this, seen so much pain

[Verse]
All the sheisty shit that I've done, blessed to not be in no chains
Uncle killed me when I was young, Mama blessed the boy with the cocaine
Growing up, I ain't have no daddy, my mama played both roles
Been hard on a nigga since I came out the womb, yeah, the pussy hole
I was taught to trust none
Face your problems, never run
Lil' bitch holler she pregnant
You a lil' nat-nat, that ain't my son
Tryna trap me, know I had a glove
Fuck them feelings, slatt, I'm a thug

I wish we woulda rolled around In some old cab and‚Åüchased‚Åüthem‚Åücity lights
And hit‚Åübars I don't‚Åülike

We were listenin' to One More Silver Dollar
Hanging out my Silverado
Down a road I love to ride

Wish I would've known that by now
You'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us
In a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love

I won't even crank th–µ boat

I sat down on a barstool, like a dern fool
'Cause she walked out again
Bartender said, ""I got you, yeah, 'cause I, too
Have been in your boots, my friend
Opened up back in '85
Got me over my first wife
Been stayin' busy since the first night""
It's a story old as time

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
God made the world in seven short days
He said it was good, I bet it was great
Then God made a man, and man got lonely
He said, ""Please, Lord, if I could only
Have an angel to hold in my arms""
So God made a girl, His best work of art
Oh, but He didn't make no place to go when she breaks your h–µart
So man made a bar

[Verse 2: Eric Church]
For some guys it's a good time, th–µ half price
Half dozen buckets of beer
Some say it's a cover band, that's a cover man
I know why they're here
Didn't go the way you planned it
Damn, the devil did some damage

That bar was made by a man

[Chorus: Eric Church]
Who built a bar, man, made a bar
Who built a bar, man, made a bar
Who built a bar, man, made a bar
Who built a bar, man, made a bar

[Verse 2: Eric Church]
He built it out of wood
Cut 'em down himself
He said, ""I'm gonna build a bar
From the ground up""
And he went and bought some nails
Went and got himself some tools
Said, ""I'm gonna build a bar
From the ground up""

Find out how it feels to let go of everything, be free

My shoes are now full of water
Lovely to be rained on with you
It's kinda cute but it's so short

And I don't wanna leave
But I have to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
Before

Bed sheets, no clothes
Touch me like nobody else does
Lovely to just lay here with you
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos

Dear God, please
Hear me out, I know it's been a couple years
Since I've reached
Out and said hello, I bet You're wondering
Why I keep
Obsessing on and stressin' all the little things
When I should be
Living life and soaking up the memories
I know I've been selfish, I have
No excuse to give You, it's true
Hanging by a thread's how I live
I don't know why, but I feel more comfortable

[Chorus]
Livin' in my agony
Watchin' my self-esteem
Go up in flames, acting like I don't
Care what anyone else thinks
When I know truthfully
That that's the furthest thing from how I
Feel, but I'm too proud to open up and ask ya
To pick me up and pull me out this hole I'm trapped in
The truth is I need help, but I just can't imagine
Who I'd be if I was happy

Yeah, been this way so long
It feels like somethin's off when I'm not depressed
I got some issues that I won't address
I got some baggage I ain't opened yet
I got some demons I should put to rest
I got some traumas that I can't forget
I got some phone calls I been avoidin'
Some family members I don't really connect with
Some things I said I wish I woulda not let slip
Some hurtful words that never shoulda left my lips
Some bridges burned I'm not ready to rebuild yet
Some insecurities I haven't dealt with, yes
I'll be the first to admit that I'm a lonely soul
And the last to admit I need a hand to hold
Losin' hope, headed down a dangerous road
Strange, I know, but I feel most at home when I'm

Livin' in my agony
Watchin' my self-esteem
Go up in flames, acting like I don't
Care what anyone else thinks

Can you pull the curtains? Let me see the sunshine
I think I'm done with my hidin' place and you found me anyway
It's been forever, but I'm feelin' alright
Tears dry and will leave no trace and tomorrow's another day

[Verse 1]
Hide and seek, I am somewhere closed away
You won't believe how long it's been since I started the game
I can't be seen and you won't find me today
I've not been this low, but I'll be okay

[Pre-Chorus]
""Are you alright?"" Maybe don't ask
'Cause you know I never like to talk about that
Keep it inside, yeah, you say I always hold back
And I always wear long sleeves
Is it in your childhood? Somethin' happen in your past?
Well, the sadness, yeah, I promise that it won't last
And if I could, I would try to take it all back
There's still more underneath and that's when you say to me

Try to breathe, see a message and don't reply
Nice to meet, but in reality, say goodbye
Life can be so beautiful if you try

But on some days, I feel like I'm trapped in a hole
But I keep quiet, so the ones around me don't know
That the mountain feels so steep
And I'll say that I'm here to help to carry the load
And the outside rays, they are good for the soul
So, let's step out of the dark 'cause, in here, it's so cold
The day's not out of reach and that's when you say to me

Jag k√§nner mig fast (Mig fast)
Jag har tagit ett piller, typ, what the fuck? (What the fuck?)
Jag √§r i tr√§det (Tr√§det), hon ropar upp (Ropar up)
Vad beh√∂ver du? (Vad beh√∂ver du?) Jag har det (Ooh-ooh)

[Vers 1: Don Toliver]
Jag vet inte varf√∂r dessa horor inte kan st√• ut med mig
Jag antar jag √§r f√∂r kr√§vande
Vill ta dubbel kokain, godiset (Godiset)

Har den Glocken, grepp stadigt (Stadigt)
B√§r den skiten, konfetti (Konfetti)
De l√•ter allt s√§ndas p√• TV (TV)
De alla vill gnida min mage
Jag har mina br√∂der ute, jag √§r i Ritz (I-)
Jag f√•r de komma in, skit ser ut som en blitz (Ser ut som en-)
Hon vill kolla in mig, hon vill kolla in min outfit (Kolla in min-)
Jag k√∂r upp, Maybach hoppar, b√§st bruden kan mina hits
Jag vet inte varf√∂r dessa horor inte kan st√• ut med mig
Jag antar jag √§r f√∂r kr√§vande
Privat ladning, jag antar jag beh√•ller mitt godis
Hon en vattenpistol n√§r str√§nderna sandiga
Jag har henne i O, kalla, b√§ttre kalla mig Randy

Yeah, hon f√∂rtj√§nar en Patek, f√∂r hon en av medlemmarna (Ja)
N√§r det kommer, √§r det f√∂rtjusande, pengar inte ett problem (Hmm)
Gjorde mig till en m√∂rdare, jag knulla nyss en modell (Yeah)
Tiffany kom bl√•, hennes fitta bra och rosa (Rosa)
Chicago under vintern, jag best√§ller p√§lsar (P√§ls)
S√§ljer ut arenor, jag r√•nade nyss gatan (Gatan)
K√∂per ett helt nytt slott i mellan√∂stern (Woo, yeah)
Min bitch sitter som en indian n√§r vi sitter ner och √§ter (Woo)
Jag kan g√∂ra den h√§r skiten, en tagning, men min stil √§r inte gratis (Woo, Pluto)
Jag tar inga horor p√• dejter, om de inte har fina f√∂tter (Jag sv√§r)
Fyra miljoner p√• hennes huvud, fyra miljoner p√• hennes huvud (Ah, yeah)
Hon g√∂r det b√§st, jag kan inte k√§nna mina ben (Mina ben, jag sv√§r)
Jag d√∂dade din man f√∂r en smula br√∂d (Man)
Har pengar upp till taket, det g√•r genom taket (Pengar)

And I got my girlfriend, she got a tan, too
And we don't got no plans

I don't know what it is, but I love it
I know that I got a bae, she got a body
I love to see her in a bikini

I miss knowing what you're thinking
And hearing how your day has been
Do you think you could tell me everything, darling?
But leave out every part about him
Right now, you're probably by the ocean
While I'm still out here in the rain
With every day that passes by since we've spoken
It's like Glasgow gets farther from LA

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe it's supposed to be this way

[Chorus]
But, oh, my love
I wanna say, ""I miss the green in your eyes""
And when I said we could be friends, guess I lied
I wanna say, ""I wish that you never left""
Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best
I wanna say, ""Without you, everything's wrong""
And you were everything I need all along
I wanna say, ""I wish that you never left""
Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best

[Verse 2]
Well, I can't help but notice
You seem happier than ever now
And I guess that I should tell you I'm sorry
It seems I was the problem somehow

Oh, yeah
Ooh

[Verse 1]
When you said you were leaving
To work on your mental health
You didn't mention the cheating, yeah
You kept that one to yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
I got so mad was gonna
Cuss you out outside your house
For everyone to see
Wanted to trash your Benz
Tell all your friends
How cruel you were to me (To me, to me)

[Chorus]
Instead I wrote a song
'Bout how you did me wrong
I could've cried at home
And spent the night alone
Instead I wrote a song
I feel much better now
M–µ and my girls are out
And we all sing along
Instead I wrot–µ a song

Could you tell where my head was at when you found me?
Me and you went to hell and back just to find peace
Man, I thought I had everything, I was lonely
Now you're my everything, I was lonely

[Verse 1]
I mixed a lot of love with a lot of drugs, then I found you
She liked petty crimes, she had green eyes like Mountain Dew
And where she go, I'll never know, her friends bounced too
I guess it's their loss 'cause they'll never know what we'll amount to
Would you be my light, be my yellow?
P.Y.T. walking down Portobello
Put a smile on this face at the end of the day
MDMA helped us fly away
Who'd have known, who'd have known you would save my life?
Who'd have known, who'd have known you would fly my kite?
Could you tell, could you tell?
Could you tell, could you tell?

Late night you would call my phone
Just to check if I was blessed 'cause you knew I was low
Head gone, rollin' off the throne
I remember, I remember, we was in the park
Late night, made love on the grass
Got my head in the clouds, countin' all my stars
In my ears, said the world was ours
Went to hell and back just to heal my wounds
'Cause it gets like that, wrong side of the moon
No Tutankhamun, you're my Cleopatra
No side thing, don't need a backup
Need a real one, don't need an actor
I lost once they think you won a BAFTA
Come and be my girl, yeah

So this is a message to NYPD

Keep a teddy bear when I sleep

Me? I'm all about keepin' the peace
I mean, at least I get paid 'cause a lot of these rappers be cappin' for free
They call me The Ock
I got the bread, she chopped but said, ""Can I bring a friend?""
Never, never, never, I guess she forgot the bev', like

Quick math, don't try it again

Her makeup is fucked, she don't know how to blend
Make her do Wordle
She need to have brains if she givin' out head
Call her Virgil

The only reason why some songs haven't been transcribed yet is because they don't have a lyrics page on Spotify, so I have to transcribe them manually from the video/audio.

Can you pull the curtains? Let me see the sunshine

It's been forever, but I'm feelin' alright
Tears dry and will leave no trace and tomorrow's another day

[Verse 1]
Hide and seek, I am somewhere closed away
You won't believe how long it's been since I started the game
I can't be seen and you won't find me today
I've not been this low, but I'll be okay

""Are you alright?"" Maybe don't ask
'Cause you know I never like to talk about that
Keep it inside, yeah, you say I always hold back
And I always wear long sleeves
Is it in your childhood? Somethin' happen in your past?
Well, the sadness, yeah, I promise that it won't last
And if I could, I would try to take it all back
There's still more underneath and that's when you say to me

But on some days, I feel like I'm trapped in a hole
But I keep quiet, so the ones around me don't know
That the mountain feels so steep
And I'll say that I'm here to help to carry the load
And the outside rays, they are good for the soul
So, let's step out of the dark 'cause, in here, it's so cold
The day's not out of reach and that's when you say to me

Uh
I just put, I just put a tonne on the back of a truck (Uh)
Me and Midgy should‚Äôve won the Cannabis Cup
I ain‚Äôt put no plaques on my wall yet
By at least five, I‚Äôll send those packs to your doorstep
In this, in this music scene I‚Äôm legendary
Raps always been secondary like February
Told my guy, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come near me with no tester‚Äù (Uh)
Don‚Äôt be talkin‚Äô packs ‚Äòround Siri and Alexa
Free the gang, I can't forget my celly
I was gettin' letters in the can, like alphabets spaghetti, uh
All these niggas bite my style
I did ""A-Wings Got Talent"" in jail, I was like Simon Cowell
I was in cali 'round the neck like bow tie
K-K-Kush God, bitch, I'm the most high
I see these rappers actin' Holly' (Uh)
When they were out there crowd surfing, we were catchin' bodies (Who were they?)
I ain't a tough guy, I always make everybody laugh
I could spit all my bars wearin' a polygraph
Rap star, still makin' pounds fly
Opps tryna' turn me stray like Ivory from How High
Used to shot ounces
Had a sold out tour, but I still got more fans in my crop houses
I spray up where you're cotchin'
Spent all my money on packs, I was literally weighing up my options
They say their guns spit, they ain't never done shit
Just landed the runtz 'bout to roll up a trumpet, uh
She want a man with P, but that bitch poor
That's why I'm in her crib hiding keys like a jigsaw
Still got food on the curb
I pull up with this half moon, I don't mean do not disturb
Came alone, could've brought an army
If I air it out, forensics will have to pick up more men than Lori Harvey
Came a long way from trappin' in the rain
My chicks a side bitch 'cause I'm married to the game, uh
Me and Budz in Dubai on a jetski
Sold so much coke like I'm rivals with Pepsi
I used to break these packs down into fractions
These niggas do way too much capping in their captions
I'm tryna leave the game but I need a lane (Uh)
These niggas pree the chain, they don't see the pain
They sent me jail for importing weed from Spain
I came home, in six weeks released a strain
Still remember reloading on a Q
We got them jungle boys, it ain't Mowgli and Baloo
The CM wishing they could bring me back
Cah they still need gangsters like me to point their fingers at, uh
Last year I was missing rap
I was on the wing kicking back with my nigga Skrapz
Even though my block's full of pricks, I ain't (Nah)
And I don't trust bitches even if my chick's a saint
Paid for my last campaign, label ain't reimbursed me
Smashed her and never picked up cah she was thirsty
They just started, I was shipping packs time ago
Trading flavours with all the growers outside my show, uh
This ain't happened cause of luck
Fuck your little chain, I spend that shit at Hakkasan on duck
To make it to a kilo, that was the game plan
When I had no 'nect like I was playing Rayman
Used to have a thirty-eight when I was trapping in the snow
Still got it to this day, I even brang it to my show, uh
I can move a hundred keys in less than a week
Driving through the other side like this is Sesame Street (Pussies)
Still the same old me even though I'm rich
And it's still gang gang, I'll never switch

Rough seas might pull me under and
Dark clouds might dim my days
But there's always bright tomorrows when
I close my eyes and say
""Remember how you've made it through the fire
Remember how you've come so far
An unstoppable force of nature
Yeah, that's what you are""

Has given me the purpose of
Conquering my pain through love
I sing this hymn to rise above

I am a mountain
And down in the valley below
Is all that I've overcome

It was dark

Cold and alone
I was looking for light

It was early
I was driving fast
I just wanted to get home

I didn't know then

I was scared of the dark
But I never saw the mountain

Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should, I might

I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him, though
Rather be in jail than alone

[Verse 2]
I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
The text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I try to ration with you, no murders, no crime of passion
But, damn, you was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach

(Don't stop, baby, you can walk through)
(Don't want,‚ÄÖbaby,‚ÄÖthink about you)
(You‚ÄÖknow that I'm never gonna lose)
Road‚ÄÖshimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a‚Äî

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
You might also like[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 2]
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
[Bridge]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

You float like a feather

Strange light revolves around you
You float across the room
Your touch is made of something
Heaven can't hold a candle to
You're made of something new
Let's not get complicated
Let's just enjoy the view
It's hard to be a human
So much to put an answer to
But that's just what we do

[Chorus]
God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow out of control
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the same

[Verse 2]
I'm having revelations
You dance across the floor
Beyond infatuation
How I obsessively adore you
That's what I do

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe
I could die in your kiss
No, it doesn't get, doesn't get
Better than this

Sleazin' and teasin', I'm sittin' on him
All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him

[Verse 1: RAYE]
A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'

[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways
You might also like[Chorus: RAYE]
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel

[Verse 2: RAYE]
Toke this joint how I'm blowin' this steam
Back to my ways like 2019
Not twenty-four hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in

[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways
[Chorus: RAYE & 070 Shake]
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel, mm (What?)

[Verse 3: 070 Shake & RAYE]
'Cause I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
Be at peace with the things you can't change (Last night)
I'll be naked when I leave and I was naked when I came, yeah
Out of reach, out of touch
Too numb, I don't feel no way
Toast up, so what?
Street small, but it go both ways
So, you'll run, yeah
But you'll never escape
Sunset in the maze
(You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel)

[Chorus: RAYE]
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night, oh
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel
[Bridge: 070 Shake]
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night

[Outro: RAYE]
Mm, lipstick smudged like modern art
I don't know where the fuck I am or who's drivin' the fuckin' car
Speedin' down the highway, sippin'
Mixin' pills with the liquor 'cah fuck these feelings
I left everyone I love on read (Uh-huh)
Spilling secrets to the stranger in my bed (Uh-huh)
I remember nothing so there's nothing to regret (Uh-uh)

You don't love me
If you loved me, you wouldn't be calling me Tuesday
You'd be calling my name, Shanice, not fucking Tuesday
You call my phone, you're asking for Tuesday
What the fuck is‚Åüthat?‚ÅüWho‚Åüis Tuesday?
You see,‚Åüthe problem started‚Åüwhen my Tuesday bitch wanted a Friday slot
And I gave it to her
Now I got Friday beefing with Thursday
Tuesday's got beef with Wednesday now, it's all mad

[Verse 1]
My Monday chick
Supermodel, always comes through on some runway shit, uh
Got me stalling like my car was in clutch
Probably woulda locked her down, but she parties too much
Tuesday got more breast than Kentucky
Airhead, but she give the best sucky-sucky (Yeah)
Wednesday got a man who plays for Chelsea
Away games, she always FaceTimes me, taking selfies
Thursday's on the 'Gram looking rich and sexy
Got an AP on, but her fridge is empty, uh (If I'm lyin', I'm dyin')
I told Friday what we could've had
But she just wanna take man for a sugar dad (Fuckin' gold digger)
I spend my weekends with the fam
So don't judge me like I'm speaking on the stand
'Cause all my hoes is a ten
And next week, I'll do it all over again

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday (Uh)

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday (All my ex girls, I love you same way, uh)

[Verse 2]
My Capricorn chick tries too much
My scorpion chick always lies too much
My Taurus chick's way too bossy
My Sagittarius chick's always rolling with a new posse, uh
I only fuck with my Libra chick when I'm high
'Cause she crazy like my chick that's a Gemini (Psycho)
My Aquarius chick never shows me love
My Aries chick just wants to hold a grudge, uh
I love chilling with my Cancer chick
But she got a temper, nearly made me crash my whip (Who you shoutin' at?)
My Virgo chick's forever fussing
And she's a know-it-all, you can't tell her nothing (Uh)
My Leo chick stays by my side
Thought I was bad, but she got way too much pride
I been running through these lighties since the nineties
Got these bitches in their feelings like a Pisces

[Chorus]
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday (Uh)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday (It's that nigga Nina with the Nina)

[Verse 3]
I ain't waiting to beat
Cah I got a different girl for every day of the week
Babes, I don't repeat
Cah I got a different girl for every day of the week
She's sayin' I'm a cheat
Cah I got a different girl for every day of the week
She can stay if she's a freak
Cah I got a different girl for every day of the week

[Outro]
It shouldn't matter the day of the week
'Cause if you like me, I'll make sure you're free
If it's a Monday or Tuesday, weekdays or Sundays
Oh, whatever I need, whatever I need

Can't just let your guard down and fall for someone anymore
That's what stupid girls do
Yeah, I've been a stupid girl
Four days away, in his arms I invest
He won't take my heart, but he'll take off my dress
Excuses rehearsed, I am blue, I am red
Fuck lookin' for love
I'ma stay doin' what us bitches do best

[Chorus]
Flip a switch on a prick, then I
Come alive in the nighttime
In the club, sippin' Hennessy
And tell him I'm dead if he callin' me
Flip a switch on a prick and I'm
A very sound bitch till you cross that line
Black heels, black shades, that my energy
Tell him I'm dead if he callin' me

[Verse 1]
You're a very silly man, block, block, mute chat
New addy in the sat, new dicks on tap
Got a best case, worst case, plan of attack
Got bitches, if they see you in the street, you're gettin' slapped
Don't threaten me or talk to me ever like that
I got brothers in the ends that'll pull up right now
You don't even wanna see the way I pull up right now

[Verse 2]
Block you off too swift
Hit a ting I used to link who always texts back fast
And I would tell you kiss my ass, I know you wish that you could
Since the fuckery from my past, I tend to move on quick, I tend to move on good
Seasoned the speed, now I'm over the man who was sleepin' underneath me
Said I couldn't live without you when I loved you
Well, I lied and you shouldn't have believed me
Twenty-four hours in the bed and believe me, it's 'bout to get freaky
Only get to see me when you see me on a phone screen, G
You no longer know me, I no longer want you, you may never hold me

Flip a switch on a prick, then I
Come alive in the nighttime
In the club, sippin' Hennessy

Can't you just make it move faster?

You're kinda cute but it's raining harder
My shoes are now full of water
Lovely to be rained on with you
It's kinda cute but it's so short

But I have to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before

Touch me like nobody else does
Lovely to just lay here with you
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos

But it's over
Then you're driving me home
And it kinda comes out as I get up to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before

I was sober for the first time in a long time
And you told me you're moving out
And I know I shouldn't, but I did
I drank every single beer in the fridge
And I told you I hate you

I don't know what I was thinking
I was thinking that I'd be okay without you
I was thinking that I'd be better off
Without you

Kiss the floor, don't be lookin' dumb cause I don't explain

I heard Jesus did cocaine on a night out
Eyes wide open, dilated, but he's fine now
And if his father ever finds out, then he'd probably knock his lights out
Gets a little messy in Heaven, gets a little messy in Heaven

[Verse 1]
Barefoot on the pavement, he was never complacent
Held his ground for the town and the statement
Leader, never backs out of the arrang–µment
Speaks out to the whol–µ crowd when he saves them
But he was the one that needed saving
Now he's low-key crushed on the inside
He gave his all and now he's breaking
You can see it in his eyes

[Chorus]
I heard Jesus did cocaine on a night out
Eyes wide open, dilated, but he's fine now
And if his father ever finds out, then he'd probably knock his lights out
Gets a little messy in Heaven, gets a little messy in Heaven

[Verse 2]
He's staying out on the weekdays, weekends
No sleep for the weak 'round here
Going out, getting lost in the deep end
White lines never dried no tears
He says no more, now he says no less
And the people wanna know where he goes next
Mind of a saint, so he knows best
But he don't sleep, nah, he don't rest
Turning water into wine, that's mad, that's mad
Everybody always wants what he has

Too much fake niggas, that's why I hate niggas
Coming around with their bad energy, fuck off, man (X10)
Leave me alone
2023, blud (HARGO Production)
Trust me, yo
Bap, bap, bap
Bap, bap, bap
Yo
I gotta protect my energy (Bap, bap)
Too much jealousy, I see a friend turn enemy
Yo, look (Boom)

[Chorus]
I gotta protect my energy (Bap, bap, bap)
Too much jealousy, I see a friend turn enemy (Grrr)
Please don't ruin my energy (Bap)
I heard it, why you keep telling me? (Why?)
I gotta protect my energy
Can't rap about beef
Or the streets
So they rap about‚Äî (Nashville)

[Verse 1]
On the back of the bike, Beverly
Jump–µd out swinging my choppa, NLE
I'm on the verge of purg–µ, especially when they keep testing me
I gotta protect my energy
My friends ain't there mentally (Nope)
Don't ask me questions, respectfully (Yeah)
'Cause I won't answer sensibly
I just wanna murder senselessly
Armed heavily
Shoot since secondary, do it professionally
Kill confirmed, don't message me
You wanna see these results? Keep testing me (Bap, bap)
I gotta protect my energy
She for the streets, sesame
She wanna swallow mans seed and have sex with me (Yeah)
He got shot in his (Woi, woi)
Now he can't breed like he had a vasectomy (Ay)

[Verse 2]
Yo, look
Still think about Drilla 'cah that was my nigga
And all of us weren't his brothers (On the gang)
I got a strong influence on others
They sayin' I brought back colors (Bluuwuu)
When I look back, all of us stressed our mothers, in prison for five whole summers
Mum ain't dumb, she's clued up, know what my crew does when we go step in with cutters
Who knows if God still fucks with me
All of the fuckery, some of it troubles me
All of the things that I'm going through currently
I just need someone to show love and cuddle me (Yeah)
Dead or in jail, man been there six times, I'm tryna avoid the other one
I brought another gun, dodging the Babylon, I know I'm troublesome
I'm finna double one
[Chorus]
Look
I gotta protect my energy (Bap, bap, bap)
Too much jealousy, I see a friend turn enemy (Grrr)
Please don't ruin my energy (Bap)

587,Relax My Eyes,ANOTR,The Reset,59,"1 ContributorKill the Spirit LyricsIn the ghetto, where you hardly see love
Sometimes hugs, but a whole lotta thugs and drugs
The value of life is low
Brothers hanging out, straight going with the flow
But the flow is twisted and wicked
You don't agree, you need to check the statistics, man
It should make you think
Can't you see the black male's on the brink of becoming extinct?

So I stop, dwell on that thought, it brings tears to my eyes
Another homicide makes me realise time is passing
Too much time is passing, so I'm going to the mountains for fasting
And that it takes place
Here I am, right back in your face with a revelation I gotta take to this nation
'Cause my people are dying of starvation, spiritually
So me, I jump on the stair, and relax
Grab my axe, and teach, over drum track, the facts which some lack
And that's the reason they act they way they act, thinking they're identifying with black
But ignorance is not black, though my people are straight-up portraying that
Selling crack in the communities, and then swearing that they're down with black unity

Yo, who ya fooling B?
Your own race, man
Are you down with the skin-heads or the klan?
I wanna know; yo, what's up with that?
Why are you so quick to peel brother man's
Cap another black on black
Shorty's locked up, home-girl's knocked up
Fell for the scam played by the male who swears he's a man
You might also likeHe never loved you, so like why should he care?
As he tells you to get on welfare
So, here we go, through the same old cycle
Playboy dad, fatherless child that'll probably just grow up buck-wild in poverty
Well, you're grabbing for something, but you're always coming back with nothing but broken dreams

Man, it seems straight useless, and that's the reason Slack produced this jam
Take of the blindfold, pushed there to realise you are the eyes of the church
And that's why ya like straight getting worked over time
'Cause once we fall in line, with a clear mind, it's revival time
So out comes the KJV 66, in goes the clip
I got my hand on the trigger, busting shots at the spirit called ""nigga""

A super shout-out to the Cush man
What you don't understand, the oldest son of Ham - Cush, the Cush man
Or, better yet, should I say Ethiopian?
A people, tall with smooth, brown skin
These parts of the bible seem to be forgotten
You see, it's not unknown, it's just not taught

I'll be the first one to pull the trigger, and kill that spirit called ""nigga"" that's been keeping my people way low, pretending everything is mellow
Well, I'm sending shouts to the ghetto
Know who you are, so you can reach your full potential
See, your history is not a mystery, it extends way beyond the sixteenth century

And the bible will clearly expose this, in Numbers 12:1, with Miriam and the wife of Moses
Interracial marriage, God didn't oppose this, but you won't find that looking at the video
Of course, you have to go to the source, and break free from the chains of the spirit that's left us all incoherent, and blind to the fact that Jesus washed that all at the cross
Some call it a tree; nevertheless, we're free - that means you and me
'Cause Jesus took the key, got up on the tree
So get rid of the peas, and pile Galatians 3:28 on your plate
Get your aim straight, and kill that spirit called ""nigga""
Spirits from hell are assigned against nations
Communities, races, a problem everyone faces
Devil, I'm taking authority over, in the name of Jesus
I bind and render your work, in order to shatter your plan to pieces

Apprehending the enemy
It's written that he should, and must be, bound before I enter and take his goods

Impart truth in ya, like an educated teacher
Living, though in time, in time, say, rhyme, preacher

Trained an equipped for war, armored still
Return to put the demons on the scope for kill

Prayed before we started, nigga spirit, we bought it
'Cause I'm addressing the last of the nigga spiritual target

As we rebuild and get rid of it
If you get it, you dig it
And we're not talking about the minute to find my anglo bits
Neither would a brother call another brother
We're speaking of a spirit that's the sign of black minds in all of mankind

Keeping you divided, envious, filled with greed, jealous of the next man - don't wanna see him succeed
Lazy and complaisant, with consumer mentality
Strangle and protect your genes and creativity
But God gives you the ability to obtain wealth
You're sticking out your hand, looking for help from someone else
Blaming it on the next man, feeling that you got to
But, with Christ and the Holy Ghost, nobody can stop you

To some, welfare is a curse from hell, no apology
Is the system designed to keep recipients in poverty?
If you're depending on the system, forgetting your gifts or job
And keep you from fulfilling your purpose in God

As soon as you get some money, you spend it with the careers
Never save or invest, but just so people can see 'em looking cool
But won't get a free PAEL grant for school
If your vision is blurry, clear it

I can't rest, I'm too wicked, I feel my mood switchin'
I ain't never gave nobody a problem who didn't want it
All you had to do was show me and I went and got it
There's an elephant in the room, but I'm sittin' on it
I got mental scars from this shit, but we're livin' off it
When they bring the streets up, I think you should switch the topic
If I'm bein' real, I don't mind, we can split the profit
I wake up and bill a rocket, last year, I saw my first M
This year, I need a couple profit, I got no tim–µ to sit and gossip
And that's word to the trap I kicked in for the things I want–µd
Ambition like mine, let me know when you come across it
They'll probably come across it and then double-cross it
Make all of them mistakes and then learn nothin' from it
It hits a little different when you're comin' from it
The struggle, that's what made you, why you runnin' from it?
I been a real dope boy, you can't beat my grind
Can't break my spirit, in the shade, I shine
You need guns when you're mixed up in beef like mine
It's hard not to smile when you got some teeth like mine
Nanny told me, ""Don't go out there, boy, it's cold outside""
I question everything I stood for and rode my time
Time and time again, one of me and there's five of them
I bring my knees to my chest and I rise again
I don't care who I might offend
If you ain't love me in the first place, why pretend?
If I sit and think about all the nights I spent on some heartbroke shit
'Cah my body gave up, but my heart won't quit
I bought fourteen grams, but my half won't flip
I got laces and boots, goals and assists
Fifty jailhouse fades, on Neighbourhood Crip
I really live this shit, you're a rappin'-ass bitch
I lost so many mates, I rub shoulders with greats
On these council estate
Tenth floor in the stairs, we used to hide from the rain
Fell in love with the life just to hide from the shade
Still shine in the shade
Kill the ego, maintain, humble, I remain
Still, I go against the grain
Real back in style, let them hate 'cause they know we are what they ain't
I wanna tell you that I'm strugglin', but I can't find the words
I wanna stay with you forever, but I need some millions first
I know that seems surprising 'cause I been a trillionaire
Blue plates and plastic bowls, I don't come from silverware
Don't get yourself killed in here
Before I sleep, I say a prayer
They got bags of energy, but nothin' to declare
This life, it left me broke, I just need someone to repair
I watched him take a lift and kept on runnin' up the stairs
I can leave the streets and just rap, I got shares
I'm too busy gettin' mine to think about yours
You can ask Theo, he was tickin' me drawers
I won't talk about the people who was givin' me squares, I ain't forgettin'
Pissed down the block, screws put me on default
They let me out for dinner and I jumped on the nettin'
I'm more rejoicin' than regrettin'
'Cah if they never kicked my head in and stripped me naked and took my beddin'
If I never climbed out all the holes I fell in
If I never had scraps, I didn't know the swellin'
If I never sold smack, I didn't know what Hell is
Then it's freedom itself, I wouldn't know the blessin'
Then they wouldn't be callin' me the hope and message
Now we're copacetic, can we toast a beverage?
'Cah when you keep it real, you keep the leverage
Real back in style, real G's in attendanceYou might also likeEmbed","Original Lyrics:

Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

White ash on my hotel floor room
Feds still watchin', hopin' they get bored soon
I'm bored of the fame, but that's my good fortune
I keep losin' all my friends and that subject's sore too
Never switch on me, I know I can't force you
I can't trust you, how could I endorse you?
I just hope you run with everything I taught you
I said I just hope you run with everything I taught you
I got white ash on these custom seats and I'm custer-free
Not talkin' in the car, they probably bugged the veecs
Go and hug your kids about you hug the streets
I don't smoke pagans, I smoke ganja leaf
I got guns for beef and leave sons deceas–µd
He's always talkin' the most, but he do–µs the least
We go kway back, I known him since dungarees
Probably hate me 'cause I know you never done the greaze
'Magine if we went school, we could've done degrees
'Stead we was sellin' crack, bitch, run the P's
Now I'm a rap star, they think I fund the streets
I got white ash on my kitchen counter
Smoke in my eye while I sit and count
I keep thinkin' 'bout yesterday's encounter
I know they're schemin' on me, I'ma lick him down
I seen man run for his life and get disembowelled
And his friends don't ride, they just miss him now
And he raps and they all wanna diss him now
Either that or they're all arse-lickin' now
I got white ash in the boardroom
I'm rappin' with execs, they're actin' all cordial
You're an informer and they treat me informal
My kids are adorable
I'm head of the family, I make it affordable
I'm killin' the rap game and holdin' memorials
Subscribe to my YouTube, I'm givin' tutorials
I rose from the crack smoke, that's different euphorias
White ash in his pipe, Frank White, I'm notorious
I was kippin' in Gloria's
Paid three for the rent, steady livin' inglorious
They ain't tryna do it, not unless there's an audience
Not a leg to stand on, he's still shootin', he think he's Oscar Pistorius
White ash on my booth floor, I don't need a chorus
They'll have you stuck in time and the jails are Victorian
My licence just done and I'm feelin' victorious
I'm curvin' all these bitches, they ain't got no decorum
I got white ash on my hotel floor room
Feds still watchin', hopin' they get bored soon
I'm bored of the fame, but that's my good fortune
I keep losin' all my friends and that subject's sore too
White ash on my kitchen counter
Smoke in my eye while I sit and count
I keep thinkin' 'bout yesterday's encounter
I know they're schemin' on me, I'ma lick him down
I got white ash on my custom seats and I'm custer-free

(That's Chucks)
Thought it was go time, like, from the jump
(Emz Beats)

[Verse 1: Potter Payper]
I link T on my just rap, you can blow shit
Still think I'm Boston George on my blow shit
My boy's in a SVR, but he stole it
I flew past **** with my wap, told him hold it
Man keep talkin' my name, they keep trollin'
When they're more pussy than the pussyoles they roll with
Can't be pillow talkin' in these streets, I disown him (Yo)
Can't be talkin' about me, I kick doors in (Check)

[Verse 2: Tunde]
I link P on my jack jones in the morning
He was one up too 'cause we're staunch and they know this
My boys in a SRT, he didn't rent it
Took chase from the black bonnet and he bent it
I flew past the back of the –µstate to go and pick him up
I sent Cappy round ther–µ and told him, ""Go and lift him up""
'Cause man keep chattin' man name, they keep cappin' it
But one ****, so now I keep **** it

[Verse 3: Potter Payper]
I've been buying watches and guns, that's insurance
Runnin' this for ten years runnin', that's endurance
I ain't worried bout nobody, they're all jokers
Like I ain't been steppin' with hammers and big boarers
Standin' on strip corners, scammers and extorters
Came too far to be standing with informers
Talk 'bout the money and then it just gets awkward
Talk 'bout the duppies and then it just gets awkward again (Yo)

I've been buying crypto and pounds, that's investing
Buyin' great Cali and Cane, this ain't wrestling
Big dogs, stepped on the steppers when we stepped in
Get money out of houses and lofts, its interesting
I've been rollin' round with some farmers, but they ain't got shotties
Know some man that turned into nitties because they got bodies
Growin' like we're in the cartel, but we don't crop poppies
Clippin' off the noses of dog, call it chopped rotties

[Verse 5: Potter Payper]
For the judge and the jury, this is entertainment
You can't be lockin' up rappers for your entertainment
I paid tax three years, never missed a payment
I'm from the mud, somehow I'm sophisticated
Might fly to a gallery and grip a painting
Used to sleep on floors, I don't need persuading
Now mummy got a CC purse with suede in
But bitch, I'd rather be rich than famous

[Verse 6: Tunde]
'Cause bitch, I'd rather be rich than famous
Got stitched by the pigs and it hit the papers
Snitch boys in the ends, gotta ditch the haters
All rats must die with a suit from Slaters
Have you straight on the wing screamin' free the strikers
Mornin' soc' on the yard, burpees with lifers
Fifty pound for a bug head, you should see the prices
If you've never hit the block, then you ain't seen a crisisEmbed","Original Lyrics:

I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
Up

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hand's been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

607,Fast Car,Luke Combs,Gettin' Old,89,"5 ContributorsFast Car Lyrics[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across th–µ border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it m–µans to be livin'

[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruising and entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
Said I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You gotta roll down the windows and let the wind blow back your hair
You gotta make up your mind, your life is going somewhere
It's time to make a change, time to take a chance
Don't let the world get in your way, it's time to make a change

[Chorus]
I know you're scared, but I can take you far
I know you're lonely, but you ain't gotta be
It's time to stop your cryin' and start drivin'
'Cause you can't have heaven with your feet on the ground

[Verse 2]
It's time to get on up, it's time to get on out
You're settin' on your dreams, you're settin' on your soul
It's time to get on up, it's time to get on out

I miss you
Your name's still on my coffee cup
I miss you
The way you chose the films we watched
I miss you, babe
If only I had told you that before
Maybe I would never have to miss you
Singing by the kitchen sink
I miss you
Not knowing I was listening
I miss you, babe
You embody everything that I am not
And, now, I'm just somebody you forgot

[Chorus]
I wish it was a year ago
I wish that I could hold you close
Now I'm driving past your house, I know
The lights are on, you're not alone
I wonder if you're making eyes
I wonder if he loves you like
The way you said that only I could do
I wish that I could tell you that I miss you

[Verse 2]
I miss you
The way you left my car a mess
I miss you
The way you took up half the bed
That empty space
You remind me of the things that I am not
And, now, I'm just somebody you forgot

I hit the ground
You didn't mind that I was bleeding out
You filled my life
With minor songs
I loved you, but you loved to do me wrong
I miss your kiss, gasoline and a matchstick
Red lights, flashes, rising out of the ashes

For who you are
But you can't break, a broken heart

And tear me up and move on to another

I'm from the hood, now I live in a mansion
These niggas are mad, I'm counting these bags while I sit in a Phantom
Word to my jewellers, I spent quarter mill on my wrist and medallion
They said I'm ugly, and now I get money she thinks that I'm handsome
Touched down Dubai with the gang and we had a fun night
Went straight to the Louis V shop, from there we went Club White
Remember them days on the estate when we had to fight over nitties
Now it's tour dates and all these bitches ask me to sign on their titties
Won't see me in a club with no shank, fam, I always bring my strally
Before I went jail I was selling stardawg and bricks of ammi
When I had no packs I had to take a trip to Cali
I ain't even bring no suitcase, I just bought a list of addys
They ain't trapping like me, we ain't got the same quotes
If you ain't tryna buy a yacht next year, we ain't in the same boat
Niggas know I'm a plug, got bottom shelf and expensive weed
And I got mids, got bandos and dispensaries

I just left mummy's house
The runners down on my feet, two and a Q
Respect from my niggas up in the trap
If it weren't for rap I'd be in there too
The feds, they hate me
They know I done some shavings bait but left no clue
Brought a hunting knife to war
Cah the three-eight never had no shoes
Told me she's leaving, why?
Cause I'm a rapper wasting her time
She hates when I'm up in DXB
Cause she knows what I do in Dubai
I end up giving them dick
I step in the club and never say ""Hi""
Then end up bussing my nut
And book her a cab, I never said ""Bye""
Course I got money, you can tell by the rip in my jeans
I'm at an awards show with my niggas daydreamin' bout hitting the fiends
I ride out sober, me and big homie pull up on the opps, drinking their lean
On road he was the baddest, went to jail now he on his deen
My niggas, they tell me to chill
Saying I spend too much on jackets
When it's time for guns I buy them, I think I spend too much on mashes
I buy waps but I'm into fashion, rather the Culli than the Phantom
I got a couple hoes from Glasgow
They just wanna fuck on me and the mandem

√âvidemment means ""Obviously"" in French.

√âvidemment is a song by La Zarra, a French singer and songwriter. The song was released in 2018 and it is part of her second studio album, ""√âvidemment"".

√âvidemment is a pop ballad that tells the story of a woman who is in a relationship with a man who doesn't love her, but she doesn't want to admit it. The song is about the pain and confusion she feels, and how she tries to convince herself that everything is fine, even though it's not.

The lyrics of √âvidemment are simple and straightforward, with a catchy melody that makes the song easy to sing along to. The chorus is especially memorable, with its repetition of ""Je suis d√©sol√©e, je sais que tu me quittes"" (""I'm sorry, I know you're leaving me"").

The music video for √âvidemment is a simple black and white video that shows La Zarra performing the song in a dark room, accompanied by a piano. The video is emotional and effective, and it adds to the song's impact.

√âvidemment is a powerful and emotional song that is sure to resonate with anyone who has been in a similar situation. It's a testament to La Zarra's talent as a singer and songwriter, and it's a song that will stay with you long after you'",13,1264,"Song: √âvidemment

It was just two lovers
Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde, fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish, no Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, ""Where you at tonight?""
Got no alibi

[Pre-Chorus]
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

[Chorus]
Shine
It's your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast, burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?

For the love of my life

A glorious look in her eyes

I don't need no light to see you

Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's tru–µ, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Tried calling yesterday but got your voicemail again
Rushed over to your Uni hall, saw‚ÄÖher‚ÄÖleaving your place
You‚ÄÖsaid you fucked up on a‚ÄÖnight out
You drank way too much, you're feeling bad now
You're tryna figure how to worm your way out

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, look at what you've done
You said you'd never do
You've fucked it for yourself
This is the end of me and you

[Chorus]
So don't call this number anymore
'Cause I won't be there for you like I was before
I should have listened to my friends
They always know best
They said you were just like all the rest, so
I'll sing it loud in case you don't already know

Was a fool, didn't see the signs
I guess my friends were always right

LyricsNotesThis song was written in response to a dream that Bush had. In the dream, she was being chased by a demon, and in order to escape it, she had to run up a hill. While running, she saw a figure holding a mirror. The figure told her that the demon could not catch her if she ran up the hill, but if she stayed at the bottom of the hill, the demon would catch her.
The title refers to the hill in the dream.

(Last night, all I think about is you)
(Don't stop, baby, you can walk through)
(Don't want,‚ÄÖbaby,‚ÄÖthink about you)
(You‚ÄÖknow that I'm never gonna lose)

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June

I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out

I remember the sickness was forever
I remember snuff videos
Cold Septembers, the distances we covered
The fist‚ÄÖfights‚ÄÖon the beach
The‚ÄÖBizzies round us up
Do it all‚ÄÖagain next week
An embryonic love
The first time that it scarred
Embarrass‚Åüyourself‚Åüfor‚Åüsomeone
Cryin' like a‚Åüchild
And the boy‚Åüwho kicked Tom's head in
Still bugs me now
That's the thing, it lingers
And claws you when you're down

[Verse 2]
I was far too scared to hit him
But I would hit him in a heartbeat now
That's the thing with anger, it begs to stick around
So it can fleece you of your beauty
And leave you spent with nowt to offer
Makes you hurt the ones who love you

You hurt them like they're nothin'

It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin' in
'Nough man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on a private jet
Life or death, five-five
Eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected

I do know my man, but I don't trust him
Trust that, Ps in the trap, disgustin'
Stick with the stick, PVA, PDA, kiss that in public
South London where I made my
South London's where I made my first hundred
Elastic bands, plastic bags, two and a blue like cheese and onion
In Jamaica, quick vacation, travellin' my pastim–µ

Any girl that I'm datin' knows, bags that I buy come filled with fifties
She a ten out of ten on a bad day, public affection, I tell her, ""Come kiss me""
I like mine obsessed, clingy
If she don't miss me, miss me
If she don't miss me, history
If she don't miss me, it's a mystery
G17 in the party, tipsy
Don't drink, that's risky
Focus, shells gonna land like Disney
And put him down under, Sydney
That's bae, I'll donate both my kidneys
True love, what the kid needs
And a girl from the Westest Indies
I know them man talk on the kid but

In this world that I'm in
How you wanna take pics with the belts in the ring
But don't help in the gym?
'Nough girls datin' their biggest haters
How her boyfriend don't want her to win? Like, rah
And why my girlfriend never wanna see me have a good time out if she ain't there?
Yeah, yeah (Fly‚Äî Fly me to the moon)
Fly me to the moon, let me get some space
Seein' them stars on her private story
I dust that chick, she got no grace
(Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter)
See her ex man, she got no taste, hip dip, she got no waist
Body snatched, servin' face (In other words, hold my hand)
Haha, hold my hand, personal trainer
Frequent flyer, bad, she toned and tan
Free my gang, 013's and 020's (Darlin' miss me)
Oh God knows, I miss my bros
I just got a call from jail on the phone and that might

When we fuck, I'ma copyright that (That's mine)
I be on a vibe
Money to the side, I'm just tryna live my life (Yeah)

There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in
[Chorus]
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

[Verse 2]
There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up

Go easy on m–µ, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel th–µ world around me

Easy On Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
I still love you
I'll always love you

[Pre-Chorus]
But, baby, I was never good at putting myself first
I was too busy building bridges from your past
Letting you in, did I protect myself?
I lost myself, didn't I?

[Chorus]
I wasn't ready, but the heavens opened up
I was still rising when you fell
I was still rising, didn't see it coming
I was still rising, didn't protect myself

[Verse 2]
I had too much pride
I was too young
I was too scared
I was so hard to please
I was so reckless with the heart I held
I was never there for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I was never good at putting myself first
I was too busy building bridges from your past

I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
Up

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hand's been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

Comin' out of my cage and I've been doin' just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm fallin' asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's takin' a drag
Now they're goin' to bed, and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

[Pre-Chorus]
Chest now, he takes off her dress now
Let me go
And I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

[Chorus]
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

The year has just started and right now, I'm lookin' for cribs overseas
I'm givin' my lady some drivin' lessons in a hundred-grand Jeep
When you see me in public, no photos, man, I need some privacy please
Good girl, she just sat on my face now she's sayin' her legs have gone weak
Bad, bad, see the jakes outside, now I'm flushin' the work down the toilet
Mad, mad, Richard Mille, a crib by the port and it's imported
Sad, sad, if you knew the truth 'bout that nigga then it would get awkward
And I know that nigga get money now, I am the nigga that taught him

[Verse 1: Young Adz]
Bro, I get the birds in, fuck a drought
Worker is misbehavin', chuck him out
I get the money, money from her house
Out in a lovely, lovely country town
I said, if you care about her, fly her out
Go to the Louis store and buy it now
I'ma keep pourin' 'til I'm runnin' out
I just hit it from the back, she scared, she runnin' out
Ooh, young and lit, money keep on comin' in
Ooh, I keep a rock band on standby, pull up and drum that shit
Ooh, deep in it, I'ma swim, hand on heart, I love this chick
Ooh, all them niggas 'round me family, love them on some brother shit

[Verse 2: Central Cee]
She suck my soul, she done it like Ash Kaash, I keep on gettin' them flashbacks
I was OT so I had to bash, I almost thought about gettin' a cab back
Do it like Rico and video that, if we upload it,  it'll probably get some backlash
Backshots, she got the ripple effect, it's too temptin' and I can't help but slap that
Fuck that, pull out, I don't wanna be a dad yet
Plan B, girl, you gotta swallow that tablet
The way that she handle it, this one talented
Pum-pum soakin', feel like I'm paddlin'
Back come 'round, I'm a fan of it
Ride on a bike one time and saddle it (Oh)
Ayo, her doctor workin' wonders
Damn, that's a big circumference (Oh)
Get her wet, she don't need no lube
On the fortieth floor, you should see the views (Alright)
She don't wanna send me her pussy on Snapchat, madman, I don't wanna leak your nudes
How do I say it without seemin' rude? (Huh)
I just wanna see if it's cute
Shake that back like a video vixen
This one here don't wanna be in my tunes
She wanna go Nobu just for the Snap
If I pay for the tab, you best eat your food
Word on the road is Cench get a hunnid a show
This ho' wan' see if it's true
Posh ting, she don't wanna be with the squares no more, she said she wanna be with the goons
Thought she could hack it, not active, too smoky, now she wanna leave the room

Ooh
Na-na, yeah

[Verse 1]
I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

[Verse 2]
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

[Verse 3]
I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said, I make you cry when I run away

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better

[Chorus]
Save your tears for another day (Oh yeah)
Save your tears for another day (Yeah)

I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away

I'm the strong one, I'm not nervous
I'm as tough as the crust of the Earth is
I move mountains, I move churches
And I glow, 'cause I know what my worth is
I don't ask how hard the work is
Got a rough, indestructible surface
Diamonds and platinum, I find 'em, I flatten 'em
I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded, but

[Verse 1]
Under the surface
I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus
Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like, ""Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus?""
Under the surface
I'm pretty sur–µ I'm worthless if I can't be of servic–µ

[Pre-Chorus]
A flaw or a crack, the straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back
What breaks the camel's back, it's

[Chorus]
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's older
Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder
Who am I if I can't run with the ball?
If I fall to
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger
See if she can hang on a little longer
Who am I if I can't carry it all?
If I falter

Under the surface
I hide my nerves and it worsens, I worry somethin' is gonna hurt us
Under the surface
The ship doesn't swerve, has it heard how big the iceberg is?
Under the surface
I think about my purpose, can I somehow preserve this?
Line up the dominoes, a light wind blows
You try to stop it tumbling, but on and on it goes

[Bridge]
But wait, if I could shake the crushing weight of expectations
Would that free some room up for joy
Or relaxation, or simple pleasure?
Instead, we measure this growing pressure
Keeps growing, keep going, 'cause all we know is

[Chorus]
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, it doesn't hurt and
See if she can handle every family burden
Watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks
No mistakes, just
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister and never wonder
If the same pressure would've pulled you under
Who am I if I don't have what it takes?

I saw you out it was zero degrees
And you had your hands right under her sleeves
Oh, you said you don't get cold
You liar!
Now I'ma set your house on fire

With gas and a match, it'll go up in flames

You want the girl with the small waist
And the perfect smile
Someone who's out every weekday
In her dad's new car
You tell me I shouldn't stress out
Say, ""It's not that hard""
But I just got a feeling
This will leave an ugly scar

If you say, ""She's nothing to worry about""
Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?

Stupid boy making me so sad
Didn't think you could change this fast
She's got everything that I don't have
How could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind

Eu vou esperar por voc√™, por voc√™

O Rollie Presidencial j√° t√° a caminho (Cansada, dizendo, ""Aye, yi, yi, yi"")
Sempre que eu encontro tempo, t√° tudo bem (Ayy)
ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob

[Verso 1: Future]
Voc√™ reza pelos meus dem√¥nios, garota, eu entendo voc√™
Toda vez que eu bebo code√≠na, fico vulner√°vel
Eu conhe√ßo os sons da tempestade quando ela ch–µga
Ela entende qu–µ eu n√£o posso levar ela pra todos os lugares que eu vou
Eu estive no campo tipo os filhos do milho

[Refr√£o: Future & Tems]
Eu posso ouvir suas l√°grimas quando elas caem pelo telefone
Fica brava consigo mesma porque n√£o consegue me deixar em paz
Fofoca, arrumando bagun√ßa, isso n√£o √© o que estamos fazendo (O mundo estava acabando)
Viajar ao redor do mundo (Voc√™ choraria ou tentaria me pegar?)
Pelo telefone, derramando l√°grimas (Me diga agora, eu quero que voc√™ seja claro, yeah)
Eu fico mais vulner√°vel quando tomo p√≠lulas (Me diga agora, eu quero que voc√™ seja claro, yeah)
Quando voc√™ t√° b√™bada, voc√™ me diz exatamente como se sente (Eu vou esperar por voc√™, por voc√™)
Quando eu t√¥ carregado, mantenho a real (Eu vou esperar por voc√™, vou esperar por voc√™)
Por favor, fala pra um verdadeiro exatamente o que √© (Eu vou esperar, vou esperar, por voc√™, por voc√™)

Eu sento na minha varanda e me pergunto como voc√™ t√° se sentindo
Eu tenho uma carreira que tira meu tempo das mulheres
Eu n√£o posso te convencer de que eu te amo pra sempre (Vou esperar por voc√™, por voc√™)
Eu vou estar te ligando, os sentimentos est√£o fluindo como um rio
Voc√™ vai estar mandando mensagens de volta pra Kiki no rio (Eu vou esperar por voc√™)
A mensagem foi entregue (Eu vou esperar por voc√™), mas eu sei que voc√™ n√£o leu
Por que voc√™ nos apresenta se voc√™ sabia que tava com ele? (Eu vou esperar por voc√™, por voc√™, por voc√™)
Me fez apertar a m√£o dele quando voc√™s estavam transando √† um minuto (Eu vou esperar por voc√™, por voc√™)
Me fez caminhar na prancha, porque voc√™ sabe que eu sou um nadador (Eu vou esperar por voc√™)
Eu deveria ser seu cachorro, mas voc√™ me colocou num canil
Garota, coloque uma focinheira nisso, em todos aqueles latidos durante o jantar
Eu tava fechado com voc√™ quando voc√™ ganhou o Presidencial pequeno
Voc√™ melhorou quando me conheceu e isso n√£o √© coincid√™ncia
Tentei trazer o melhor de voc√™, acho que eu n√£o sou t√£o influente
Acho que eu n√£o sou o cara para voc√™

It‚Äôs in the moments where I think that I‚Äôm better alone
That's when I remember, that's when I remember
Every time I walk past your house in the rain
And I tell myself that you were the biggest mistake
And just when I think I‚Äôm finally doing okay
That's when I remember, that's when I remember

[Verse 2]
My friends tell me I shouldn't listen
To the voices that go round in my head
So I try to delete all the memories
But you're really hard to forget

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

And you're not here to get me through it all

The chorus of the song goes as follows:
""I don't like the party scene, I like the after party when you're mine
Got me feeling like I'm the king, and you're my queen
We ain't the type to talk about it, we just do it

The verses of the song are about living a lavish lifestyle and enjoying the company of a special someone. The lyrics go as follows:
""Bought a brand new car and I'm cruising with my friends
And we're making moves and we're having fun
Got the baddest chick in the club, she's got a pretty face
And she's looking good, and I'm feeling fine
We're getting money, we're getting paid
We're having fun, we're having a good time

We're the baddest people in the room
We're the baddest people in the room
We're the baddest people in the room

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis

One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming

And I'm a monster on the hill

Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your touch some nights when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
Since the love that you left is all that I‚Åüget,‚ÅüI‚Åüwant you to‚Åüknow

[Chorus]
That if I‚Åücan't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (More than life)
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life

Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I need more time, but time can't be borrowed
I'd leave it all behind if I could follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know

That if I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (Yeah)

If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly wer–µn't aware that you made me mis–µrable
So if you really wanna know

Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

[Verse 3]
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
He took me in his arms, I heard him say
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die (Good job, Sho)
My father told me

[Chorus: SwitchOTR]
Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
I'll-I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
You-you better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you
Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
I'll-I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
You-you better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you

[Verse 1: SwitchOTR]
See, I ain't really into the verbal
My broski strapped, no Dijk, no Virgil
The van might buss that circle
See, I'm tryna blow off this music ting
And pray that I end up commercial
And 'bout time that I make some records
Show them why that I go universal
('Cause I can't) 'Cause I can't get stuck in the ends
I need me a yard with a big ass fence
Lambo truck or Mercedes-Benz
No fake love, no need to pretend
If I cut you off, it's straight intent
Guys out here tryna drill and repent
Same bad B that I need in defence
The J1's coulda been A1, but I can't follow the latest trends
Broski might handle the can and let off shots, 'cause the bullets bisexual
It's really for them boy there, can definitely hit that bitch right next to you
Every time I rap on the beat, gotta show them why man feels presentable
And chicks love pick and choose their guys like a video game collectible

The world so fucked nowadays, I don't trust no one

I can't stop working, we all die one day
Back then, I was lonely (Lonely)
I ain't got time for these phonies (Phonies)
Got my bro like Zack got Cody
I'm a top boy like Modie (Ah-ah)
Anti-social, I don't like to socialize
They cap on the net, that's social lies
When brodie died, I cried, that's real life
I feel a way, I just don't feel right
Could've been homeless

You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't wanna go home right now

And all I can breathe is your life

Let's go!

[Verse 1: Mirabel & Ensemble, Both]
This is our home, we've got every generation
So full of music, the rhythm of its own design
This is my family, a perfect constellation
So many stars and everybody gets to shine
Woah (Oh-oh-oh-oh), let's be clear, Abuela runs this show
Woah (Oh-oh-oh-oh), she led us here so many years ago
Woah (Oh-oh-oh-oh), and every year our family blessings grow!
There's just a lot, you simply got to know, so

[Chorus: Mirabel]
Welcome to the Family Madrigal
The home of the Family Madrigal (We're on our way!)
Wher–µ all the people ar–µ fantastical and magical
I'm part of the Family Madrigal

[Interlude 1]
[Alejandra, Juancho & Cecilia] ""Oh my gosh, it's them!""
[Alejandra] ""What are the gifts?""
[Cecilia] ""I can't remember all the gifts""
[Alejandra] ""But I don't know who is who""
[Mirabel] ""Mm-mm-, alright, alright, relax!""
[Alejandra] ""It is physically impossible to relax!""

My t√≠a Pepa, her mood affects the weather
When she's unhappy, well, the temperature gets weird
My t√≠o Bruno (We don't talk about Bruno!)
They say he saw the future, one day he disappeared
Oh (Oh-oh-oh-oh), and that's my mom Julieta, here's her deal
Woah! (Oh-oh-oh-oh), the truth is, she can heal you with a meal
Woah! (Oh-oh-oh-oh), her recipes are remedies for real
If you're impressed, imagine how I feel‚ÄîMom!

[Chorus: Mirabel, Mirabel, Felix & Agust√≠n]
Welcome to the Family Madrigal
The home of the Family Madrigal (Hey, coming through!)
I know it sounds a bit fantastical and magical
But I'm part of the Family Madrigal
Two guys fell in love with Family Madrigal (Hey, Family Madrigal!)
And now they're part of the Family Madrigal
So, yeah, T√≠o F√©lix married Pepa and my dad married Julieta
That's how Abuela became an Abuela Madrigal (Let's go, let's go!)

[Verse 3: Abuela]
We swear to always help those around us
And earn the miracle that somehow found us
The town keeps growing, the world keeps turning
But work and dedication will keep the miracle burning
And each new generation must keep the miracle burning
[Interlude 2]
[Alejandra] ""Wait‚Äî who's a sister and who's a cousin?""
[Cecilia] ""There's so many people!""
[Juancho] ""How do you keep them all straight?""

So many kids in our house, so let's turn the sound up!
You know why? I think it's time for a grandkid round-up!
(Grandkid round-up!)

[Verse 4: Mirabel & Townspeople, Both]
Cousin Dolores can hear a pin drop
Camilo shapeshifts, Antonio gets his gift today
My older sisters, Isabela and Luisa
One strong, one graceful, perfect in every way
(Isabela!) Grows a flower, the town goes wild
(Isabela!) She's the perfect golden child
(Luisa! Luisa! Luisa! Luisa!) And Luisa's super strong
The beauty and the brawn do no wrong

[Chorus: Mirabel & Ensemble]
That's life in the Family Madrigal (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now you know the Family Madrigal (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Where all the people are fantastical and magical (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
That's who we are in the Family Madrigal
[Interlude 3]
[Mirabel] ¬°Adi√≥s! ""Ooo!""
[Alejandra] ""But what's your gift?""
[Mirabel] Ha!

[Chorus: Mirabel & Ensemble]
Well, I gotta go, the life of a Madrigal (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
But now you all know the Family Madrigal (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I never meant this to get autobiographical (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
So just to review the Family Madrigal, let's go

[Verse 5: Mirabel & Children]
(But what about Mirabel?)
It starts with Abuela, and then T√≠a Pepa, she handles the weather
(But what about Mirabel?)
My mom Julieta can make you feel better with just one arepa
(But what about Mirabel?)
My dad Agust√≠n, well, he's accident-prone but he means well
(But what about Mirabel?)
Hey, you said you wanna know what everyone does, I got sisters and cousins and (Mirabel!)
My primo Camilo won't stop until he makes you smile today (Mirabel!)
My cousin Dolores can hear this whole chorus a mile away (Mirabel!)
Look! It's Mister Mariano, hey
You can marry my sister if you wanna
But between you and me, she's kind of a prima donna
Yo, I've said too much, and thank you but I really gotta go! (Mirabel!)

Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
And by now, you shoulda somehow realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

[Verse 2]
And backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how

You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

And what I think about

One love, one house

Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
[Verse 2]
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for

Outside, it starts to pour

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the tide
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you
You might also like[Verse 2]
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you (Crawlin' back to you)
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few? (Had a few)
'Cause I always do ('Cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (Maybe I'm too busy)
Busy bein' yours (Bein' yours)
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

(Do I wanna know?) Too busy bein' yours to fall
(Sad to see you go) Ever thought of callin', darlin'?

Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of shit
And you would never know a god without the goddesses
Honest as fuckin' honest get
And I could be on everything
I mean I could be the leader, head of all the states
I could smile and jiggle it 'til his pockets empty
I could be the CEO, just look at Robyn Fenty
And I'ma be there for you 'cause you on my team, girl
Don't ever think you ain't hella these niggas dream girl
They wanna pit us against each other
When we succeedin' for no reasons
They wanna see us end up like we Regina on Mean Girls

I pull up in the middle of the night
Darlin', I don't wanna see you cry, yeah
Nanny prayin' for me, I‚Äôm fine
Told her, ""I‚Äôma be alright"", yeah
Maybe it's all me, or maybe it's all you
Let's take a trip overseas
Love each other how we supposed to

[Chorus: Young Adz]
No tantrums, girl, no tantrums
I'm in the Shangri-La with a hand ting
Drug dealers and killers and the mandem
Wanna make you smile, take you out
Like my lady with melanin, yeah
Big MAC-10, clap ten of them, yeah
Big Rolls-Royce truck to make an impression
Them guys irrelevant, y–µah
You can take all my love
Ain't no line that I won't cross just to mak–µ you smile
Scary sometimes, but it‚Äôs fine
I'll walk the mile and swim across sea to make you smile

[Verse 2: Dirtbike LB]
(Uh), I came on a madness (Uh), I'ma slide with my lady in Atlantis (Uh)
And I dive in the pool with the ice on my arm, that's a waterproof Patek (Uh)
And my little nigga rich, I'ma show him how to ball like he played for the Mavericks (Yeah)
My lady attractive, that skin smooth with no tatts (Yeah)
There's drillers and drummers in here, mind the gap on the exit (Yeah)
They wait 'til you blow up then niggas appear, but that is a death wish (That's a death‚Äî)
You ain't sat in a room full of killers that's armed, this nigga's pretendin' (Pretendin')
I walk with my heart, pray to Allah, that‚Äôs for my redemption

No tantrums, girl, no tantrums
I'm in the Shangri-La with a hand ting
Drug dealers, and killers, and the mandem
Wanna make you smile, take you out
Like my lady with melanin, yeah
Big MAC-10, clap ten of them, yeah
Big Rolls-Royce truck to make an impression
Them guys irrelevant, yeah
Take all my love
Ain't no line that I won't cross just to make you smile
Scary sometimes, but it‚Äôs fine
I'll walk the mile, and swim across sea to make you smile

[Verse 3: AJ Tracey]
Trace-O
She's on heat, I ain't seen her for a while
My ladies always killlin' with style, yeah
In the Bentley truck, rollin' up loud
I'm tryna give her 'rounds in the cloud, yeah
Date night, shout if you need collection
Feel it in her soul, that's a deep connection
She know we hot, she ain't seen the Wesson
West style, I'ma teach the lesson
I'm with 29, twenty nines in the buildin'
I got bare kids, but I've never had children, no
Bare rap cappers in this music, they wanna do shit
I got a status, I can't lose it, no
I drop Tec in my soda
Lamb' truck same colour as Cola
Never had to lease that, I'm the owner
All this from my own Motorola
[Chorus: Young Adz]
No tantrums, girl, no tantrums
I'm in the Shangri-La with a hand ting
Drug dealers, and killers, and the mandem
Wanna make you smile, take you out
Like my lady with melanin, yeah
Big MAC-10, clap ten of them, yeah
Big Rolls-Royce truck to make an impression
Them guys irrelevant, yeah
Take all my love
Ain't no line that I won't cross just to make you smile

(It's Tekky)
Hey, ooh
Whoa, baby (WhYJay)
Hey, ooh
Whoa, baby
Ah, ah, ah
ArrDee, ArrDee

[Chorus: ArrDee]
I don't give girls flowers, I'll give you good wood though
If you want me all for yourself, then, darling, you probably should go
There's no way I'ma stand in the rain
I can still make you say my name, say my name, say my name
Life without me might drive you insane
I don't give girls flowers, I'll give you good wood though
If you want me all for yourself, then, darling, you probably should go
There's no way I'ma stand in the rain
I can still make you say my name, say my name, say my name
Life without me might drive you insane

[Verse 1: ArrDee, ArrDee & Lost Girl]
Nah, babe, I can't make your day but I can make your night
See, I ain't the trustin' type and it's lust, not lov–µ
And she said, ""I'm done this time 'caus–µ
You make love to me like I'm the one
Then run off and duck my calls for a month
Make me feel special and then like a mug
Got you up in my guts but I hate your guts""
I come back, darling, why you rantin'?
Girl, I'm single, and I always have been
Never promised you nothin' but panting
Sweating 'em plans on a late night antics
She said ""You don't show me no respect
And you're only callin' me for the sex""
At least I call 'cause the rest just all come crawlin'

Life without me might drive you insane
I don't give girls flowers, I'll give you good wood though
If you want me all for yourself, then, darling, you probably should go
There's no way I'ma stand in the rain
I can still make you say my name, say my name, say my name
Life without me might drive you insane

[Verse 2: ArrDee]
Might drive you crazy, psycho
I'm wavy so I'm textin' typos
But you know what I'm on, come mine, girl
We can stay up all night 'til the light show (Come through)
She said, ""If I'm comin', I'm comin' to talk
Ain't comin' to cum 'cause I'm done and I'm bored
Not some little whore who will come anytime that you call
We ain't cool anymore""

[Bridge: ArrDee]
Ahh, tsk, why you gotta be like that?
You know you'll miss me and you'll be right back
And you're not a whore, you shouldn't speak like that
I'm nothin' but honest, you know how it is
The life that I live, I don't want a chick, I don't wanna settle
You know you're my favourite petal, but-
[Chorus: ArrDee]
I don't give girls flowers, I'll give you good wood though
If you want me all for yourself, then, darling, you probably should go
There's no way I'ma stand in the rain

Life without me might drive you insane

[Outro: Sweet Female Attitude]
I'll bring you flowers in the pouring rain
Living without you is driving me insane
I'll bring you flowers, I'll make your day
The tears you cry, I'll dry them all away, away9Embed","Please provide the complete text you'd like me to paraphrase.

Double D, big full breasts on my baby
(Yo, we going to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work
Boss ain't working you like this
He can't take care of you like this

[Chorus]
Now you're lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

[Verse 2]
Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
(There he goes, one of God's own prototypes)
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl
(Too weird to live, too rare to die)
No, I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
Nor have I ever, have I ever let you get caught?

It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay and these girls know that I'm nasty (Mmm)
I sent her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her ass cheek
City talkin', we takin' notes
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts
Wish he could, but he can't get close
OG so proud of me that he chokin' up while he makin' toasts
I'm the type that you can't control, said I would, then I made it so
I don't clear up rumors (Ayy), where's y'all sense of humor? (Ayy)
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turned my haters to consumers, I make vets feel like they juniors (Juniors)
Say your time is comin' soon, but just like Oklahoma (Mmm)
Mine is comin' sooner (Mmm), I'm just a late bloomer (Mmm)
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter (Woo)

Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers

Felt like I knew you before you were born
Baby, I remember you from the start
Baby, I'll never forget you, not even for a second
And I know you got dreams, you got them, and you're gonna make it happen
I'll be right here if you ever need a friend
I'll be right here, I'll be right here, I'll be right here

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
If I could take back all the times I didn't call you
Or all the things I didn't say
I'd go back in time, take back the moment
That we stood atop the world and took that fall
I'd take back the ""I love yous""
I'd take back the ""I miss yous""
I'd take back the last time that I saw you

[Verse 2: Charlie Puth]
Sometimes I think about you
And I hope you think about me too
I hope you know that I'm down for you
'Cause I'm down for you
I would take back the night that we fought
And the words I couldn't say
I'd take back the kiss that I should have kissed
And the car I should've driven
I'd take back the last time that I saw you

Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, and the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

And if you like having secret little rendezvous

And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like goin' places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreamin' about

Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long

You, where the hell did you come from?
You're a different, different kind of fun
And I'm so used to feeling numb
Now I've got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come
Like a finger on a loaded gun

That one day I will be, where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, they're much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call? (Who's to say you won't hear me?)
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, they're much too strong

But as long as you are with me, there's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever, exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat

With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries

If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it

Make it everlasting so nothing's incomplete
It's easy being with you, sacred simplicity

Right, I shoulda known you were bad news
From the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos
'Cause most guys only want one thing
But I'm undecided, tryna figure out if that's you
Either way though, I think you're worth a test drive
'Cause (Ooh) you're so much better than the next guy
And a little trouble only makes for a good time
So all the normal red flags be a good sign

Don't you come here thinkin' you're ballin' (Oh, nah)
Ain't down for it, you seem like trouble to me
I can tell by the way that you lean and the way that you kiss your teeth
And you turn up so fresh and clean, smells like trouble to me

Opposites attract, I guess this is that
Good girl, bad guy, what a perfect match
And if we (Ooh), you're gon' wanna pay back tithes

[Intro: Fetty Wap]
Yeaaah baby, 17

Ay, ay, look

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Baby girl, you're so damn fine, though
I'm tryna know if I could hit it from behind, though
I'm sipping on you like some fine wine, though
And when it's over, I press rewind though, ayy
You talking bands, girl, I got it
Benjamins all in my pocket

He playing Batman, Fetty's gon' rob him, ayy
I got a Glock in my 'Rari, ayy
17 shots, no .38
I got a Glock in my 'Rari
17 shots, no .38

I'm like, yeah, she's fine

I‚Äôm like, ""Yeah""
I got Robins on my jeans
You see the wings on every pair
All you see is Remy Boyz

And if somebody got a problem
We could meet up anywhere
Now go say something
Don‚Äôt you niggas play dumb
You know where we came from
You don‚Äôt want sauce, no A1

What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

In my head for you

737,I'm Not The Only One - Radio Edit,Sam Smith,I'm Not The Only One,61,"52 Contributors30,000 Word Rap Song (World Record) Lyrics[Part I]

[Intro 1]
Please, this shit's so fuckin' hard
Helluva Beats
Yeah, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
Thirty-thousand words in a rap
That's a first, and, in fact, that's the most in the world on a track
Yeah, I've been searchin' the map
For like any other person who could work it like that
Do it perfectly slow and then perfectly fast
I'm the only one that's out here, and I'm certain of that
Play me a beat, it gets turned into ash
If I play you a beat, it gets turned into trash
Ayy, hold up, wait
When I'm on the track, I make no mistakes
I can do the shit for like thirty-thousand hours
Fuck thirty-thousand words, I don't slow my breaks
I go UK, then I make so many pounds
Everybody think I'm overweight
Gettin' bread, see me eatin'
But I gotta go in, better hold my plate
Ooh, ooh, gotta switch up
I'm so godly, I'm the bishop
Now these haters wanna link up
My bars make them get the hiccups
So I had to run it up real quick
Freestyle, gotta do some real shit real quick
Everything I do is real big
'Cause I gotta get the crowd to feel this,  real lit, real shit
Nowadays, they write me and I don't write it back
See my future demons like a psychic and a psychopath
Swear I'm drivin' down the road and I might'a crashed
Do the dash, always movin', don't know where to find me at
Hey, movin' on, gotta find a team
Earnin' all my stripes like Camilla, but I'm lima beans
All these rappers 'bout to get fucked like they Riley Reid
I'm your teacher, so be quiet or I am assignin' seats
Pioneer to the shit, Leif Eriksson
I was even hunted, 2012, like I'm Jerry Lynn
All these places got me sneezin', need a Claritin
Until I fall off next year, I'ma be arrogant
Yeah, I'm runnin' all this shit, run it up
Yeah, you know that I be comin' up for a hun'ed bucks
At the start, all I wanted was like thirty-thousand hits
Got bored, add a couple zeroes for the shits
Why not? Look what I got, look what I bought
Camera is my true eye, I'm a side-clause
Shoes, they go too high, only high-tops
Fuck yeah, I'm the new guy, what am I on?
Come in, Jaden Smith, I'm a motherfuckin' icon
Boy, I'm too cold, I don't even have on my ice on
Too lit, I don't even have the mic on
And I'm too bright, I don't even have the lights on
Better wait up
Shit's too easy, like a layup
And my bitch too entertainin'
See the note, you gotta stay up
Takin' bets on that I'll fail
It's time to pay up
Now you tryna hide your face
I'm pretty sure that that ain't make-up, uh
I'm droppin' hits and gettin' world records
Who's your favorite artist, 'cause I'm sure better?
Well, maybe not, but I tried, though
Post Malone, I go psycho
Leave you a stink, like a rhino
'Cause I rap beef, no gyro
And I rhyme fast and I rhyme slow
Turned my L's into W's; typo
Uh, hop into the track
Give you the love and you give it right back
Ten different flows I be spittin', some trap
And some other shit get in it's get on the map
Done this for like a year, and now, my writing's clear
I've been gettin' respect, 'cause now I am here
And I'm here to stay, did you hear me say
""I'm not here to play""?
""He got a flow and a voice now
I remember when he chokin' a boy out
But he's back in, showin' no choice now
Don't you know that he's gonna destroy now?""
So I'm gonna get there, and I know how
Got these beats, I be blarin' 'em so loud
When we talk about bitches and money, this shit is so funny
My parents are so proud, damn
I'm startin' to try
Tryin' the shots at it, look at the ground and see stars in the sky
Drawin' the line
All of you rappers are dizzy, I can see the stars in your eyes
You're probably high
If you think that you compare to me, it must be part of the lines
Copyin' guys
You better send all those beats back to Future, like Marty McFly
Thirty-thousand words on a track, lil' bitch
Now these people turn my vid on and react, lil' bitch
Know I got the clout, I got the stats, lil' bitch
And you givin' me a headache, where's the Advil, bitch?
But I'm doin' all I can, and I did it in the past-tense
Makin' all this money up off of YouTube, off me AdSense
Money up off of YouTube, off AdSense
All of you are wack, that's a fact, I'ma rap then
And I rap, huh, I'm a laptop
Eminem holds the world record for ""Rap God""
1.6K words
Though, we already have that topped
And we'll do it for another hour
And I'm underrated and I'm underpowered
My bars are so filthy, uh
All of y'all need to take another shower
For every fan, there's a hundred doubters
And they let me know up in the comments
But you know that we ain't done
'Cause I gotta talk my nonsense
And I gotta keep it clean, uh
Do exactly what my mom says
And I know when they headed for the top
And we still be makin' progress
I can spit bars for nine months
Then deliver you a new life
Yeah, we eatin' in this bitch, uh
All y'all better take a huge bite
And I didn't even write that shit
'Cause I freestyle, you still like that shit
See my video, press 'like' on it
That subscribe button? Better wipe that shit
I'm getting tired of this beat
I think it's time to change it
'Cause I'll spaz on trap
Old school boom-bap, you name it
Think of that as a intro
Now we get into the meat of it
This some shit you didn't see comin'
I don't give a fuck 'bout what you think of it!

[Intro 2]
Heh, ayy!
Ayy, ayy
Uh, switch up
Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2]
Look out the window, see past it, but we're faintin' reflections
You never laugh like you used to, you've got fainter expressions
You headin' down the wrong path and they changin' directions
Maybe don't mention 'bout how I made me your blessin'
And lately, I question the shit that was taught to me
I'm awkwardly stoppin' these conversations
Hey, how long you waitin' till the day you wake up and thank God you made it?
I don't like to dwell, but man, I gotta say it, don't like my songs, but you still gotta play it
Don't like your road, just N.W.A., Dr. Dre it
Stop contemplatin' and stop complainin'
And recreate it, actually, don't recreate it, be creative
Reached the place where you still vibe in that shit when we replay it
Living a life of pain just to alleviate it
When you haven't used nothing but distractions to really take it
Yeah, maybe they'll change when they see we made it
We headin' onto new platforms and leavin' the basics
[Verse 3]
Uh, my creative process is making progress
Despite my background, I haven't gotten to playin' lacrosse yet
Don't you know we got a good thing goin'?
I've been watchin' all these shows while I could be showin'
I've been creeping up on the door, so dangerous
You looking at statistics, while I figure how I'm changin' them
I done learned so many things in my past life
Now I don't give a single shit about the rap life
That's nice, ain't it? That's nice to be given advice when I paint it
Have twice much the fame, and
I can't even comprehend that much in the future
Hatin' the teacher, but you loving the tutor
Enter the game, I'm a fuckin' intruder
Stealin' these flows, man, I'm stuck as a looter
Procrastinatin' 'cause my fucking computer
No willpower, I'm just stuck as a loser

[Verse 4]
Sittin' alone at 3 AM
Chillin' on a late night is the weekday's friend
Man, this shit is too wild, I ""must behave, Ben""
That's what the teachers are preachin' to me, but even when
I'm on the top of this drop and they're rocking the world with confidence
Accomplishments topplin' everyone and you try stoppin' it?
-Obvious there's a problem, and solvin' it just ain't up to me
Luckily, I've been trained to test the system, don't you fuck with me
I hope you like my company, I hope you do appreciate it
I hope that one day, you'll see we made it
No, you cannot recreate it, all of this pain, I just alleviate it
I'm just trying to find the mindset, grinding to be the greatest
That is why I'm strivin', livin', tryin', I'm buyin'
I'm givin' dignity, cryin', I'm winnin', but feel like dyin'
I'm shining, I'm like a diamond, but I am dead on the inside
Guessin' now we'll rest with this, but set it on my big mind
[Hook 1]
And I'm in time
-Workin' all my life, get that in line
I'm tryna figure out, everyone get their pictures out
Nobody's gonna live without this shit on the incline
I'm on the incline, I'm on the incline
Stay in your lane, you got your place and I'm in mine
I'm on the incline, bitch, I'm on the incline
Nobody can really understand how my shit climb

[Verse 5]
Have I been livin' yet? Spendin' time on the internet
I'm wastin', they hatin' it, I should be makin' it, aimin' for goals but takin' this shit instead
I stay in bed, laughin' at stupid shit, ludicrous
Who is this ten-year-old pregnant with two new kids? Why am I doing this?
Why the fuck do I care? I don't, but I kinda do
I don't know what I try to do, but whatever it is, I say, ""Bye"", to you
Hey, me, I lied to you! Don't realize? Well it's time you do
You have no idea what I can do, when the skies are gray, you gotta find a blue
You gotta try to do, something to put you into a new positive mindset
Set headlines, go wreck lines, pass deadlines, leave lines dead
I guess that I digress, and I digest the way I'm blessed
Impressed after I'm pressed, you seek intent for what I said
But I'm just gonna move on, get your groove on for my new song
Do right, and you do wrong, got a big head, Jimmy Neutron
You try to hate, well, get in line, just delivered some quick rhymes
Some straight bars, we have came far, but we lookin' up on the incline

[Interlude 1]
Water break
I got a lot to say
It's been eleven minutes so far
Actually, it hasn't, it's been shorter

[Verse 6]
How can
I have a believable meaning
When all of you livin' in paradise, livin' in luxury
Nobody seen it or  greet it?
But what if it's different? I mean, it's all seeming to be
And it's in inconceivable dreaming
I know it's so unbelievable, being
Stuck in this rare unachievable feeling
They givin' me something, I ended up leaving
They givin' me nothing, I ended up grievin'
No positive side, ended up seeing
What life could be like from a  different lead in
Thank God for a cover zone
So I know when and where to cross it
All over the place
I'm surprised I haven't lost it

[Hook 2]
Yeah, ayy, and I'm feeling like I'm at the top, uh
Livin' to the max now
Yeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud
I'm steppin' up, I never back down, more focused on my background
And the music and how my rap sounds, speak up, cut the track down
Go till the end, I don't back out, stuck in the trap, figure that out
After, I'll do the math now, it's garbage, take the trash out
But I'm here to stay till I pass out, blackout

[Verse 7]
Okay, it's time to go fast
So sit back and relax, and just maybe you'll get it
About time, but maybe you're mad I said it
You gon' pay attention, cash or credit?
I have to let it go back a second
I have some lyrics in the past that I have to edit
Now we're back in the middle of the track and fed it
Mix it up and if you talk, then, nah, forget it
We moved on, walked past the exit
Want you to come back and pass a message
-Never pack bags and trash, you left it
Kinda sucks that sometimes we have to end it
Money, never am glad I spent it
If I ever had told you I'm mad, I meant it
If you ever feel bad or sad, accept it
Think back to the track and the rap that Ben did
Yeah, pretty obvious I'm killing it
If this isn't my time, then maybe you need a syllabus
I'm feelin' all the rhythm, you can tell that I am into this
Voice is more powerful than a million instruments
Suddenly, lyrics go demon, like it's somebody else
People want me to grow because of you
But I'm never going to level my endeavors to be better
Than the people that never had trust in me
Yeah, uh

[Hook 3]
And I'm feeling like I'm at the top, yeah
Livin' to the max now, uh
Yeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud
I'm stepping up, I never back down, more focused on background
And the music and how my rap sounds

[Verse 8]
Speak up, and they're messing with the track now
People are tellin' me that I'm fallin' short
Looking back at you when you're missing all the cash now
And I'm mad at the fact that
I'm not in my right mind
Meant to be a half-decent rapper
But I keep on saying all the wrong words at the right time
Lookin' at yourself, you never know what you might find
Lookin' at the sky in the middle of the nighttime
I find so much life
I wonder why I can't just find mine
Got so many confusing questions
So much knowledge, I can't use the lessons
I'm emerging out with a new profession
I'ma do the best with my new perfection
And I'm doin' it
I'm moving onto this future shit
These hooligans are complete fools in that
They just don't understand that I am through with it
Improvin' it, I'm improvin' it
I got my brain, and I'm usin' it
And I'ma make it out alive when I'm playin' and takin'
And makin' this cash, that I'm tearing these tools to bits
You're clueless
Ninety percent of y'all ignorant
Keeping your minds oh-so limited
Get off your high horse, because it is time to figure it out
Seeming so close, I can picture it now
Success in my drink, and I'm sippin' it now
Envisioning deeper ambitions, and now
I'ma get to it, that is what living's about

[Interlude 2]
Uh, God!
Uh
My voice is gone already, shit
Alright, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 9]
Think I've got a consensus, bein' lost in the trenches
Adolescent lessons expressin' God's job is to tempt us
Makin' it hard to stay alive, it's so easy to die
Makin' you hang your head low, but say, ""Reach for the skies""
Life is a walkin' contradiction, I see through its lies
I'm just tryna tell the stories I've seen through its eyes
I feel I'm forcing and feeding of off reasons to cry
With all this fake deep bullshit, I'm too eager to try
Yeah, everybody sendin' blessings in need of reply
Tryna sell their own tears, for they bleedin', they dry
Fuck your demons inside, I'm in need of the, ""Why?""
So I can summarize my life through my breathing and sigh
Like, oh well, I can say that I tried
Hopped into life and then I stayed for the ride
So many beautiful faces, but they vacant inside
And I'm just patiently waiting for the day I decide, damn
This reminds me of days when I drive in L.A.‚Äã
I'm screamin', ""Hi"" to the sky up with a smile on my face
Now I'm hidin' my face, I keep tryin' to trace
All of the steps that I had taken to findin' my place
Swept out to oceans so lonely, waves feel like an embrace
And now I'm lookin' at my mic like it's sent as a prophet
I used to be an atheist, but that turned me agnostic
Recently, I've been wondering if I've fuckin' lost it
See my friends from kindergarten go to rehab
That's the type of shit that makes you think back
To simpler times, blissfully ignorant minds
Before reality could ground us, we would live in the skies
And as a- and as a kid, I never thought I'd be bein' like this (Nah)
Man, as a kid, I never thought this would even exist
I felt elusive, intangible, just steam in the mist
And now I'm wakin' up feelin' I ain't even this shit
You only look at what you got once you see that it's lost
And life's too gradual for me to believe in my sauce
Don't understand rappers braggin', ""I got that paper on me""
Man, I got kids in schools who doin' presentations on me
So what the fuck you really value tryin' to take that from me?
To me, I'll take that over Rollies and makin' some money
Rain or sunny, I'ma do this every day, I study
And write these lyrics till my brain is fuzzy, damn
Like Tyler, Creator tweets, I just capitalize
These Romans tally up my hits with the capital 'I's
This is a natural high
I see it comin' from afar, I'm still actin' surprised, but I ain't mastered the skies
I wrote this album so much passion, I actually cried
They say 'cause I was never trappin', my rap is a lie
They think 'cause I'm a awkward kid, I'm invalid
As DJ Khaled's son receivin' a platinum plaque for bein' alive
Threw out half of my album, it wasn't good enough
Shit, I mean it still isn't good enough
I'm like a active volcano, I know I could erupt
But I guess I am not full enough, damn
I swear, the higher you get, that's the lower you feel
Man, that's more shit you gotta do, or you won't get a deal
Man, that's more shit you gotta prove so they know that it's real
Thirty seconds of listenin', thinkin' you know how I feel
Yeah, said this a motherfucking thesis statement
Yeah, came a long way, I cannot be complacent
Every day I wake up stressed, I have to be the greatest
And if not, then that's a day I truly feel I've wasted
Most of the pressure on my shoulders is comin' from me
So when I die, I know I left us with something to leave
So when I wake up in the morning with something to see
Yeah, I got so much shit that I'm wantin' to be

[Verse 10]
Benny, Ben, Benjamin, Selena Gomez has said
If you ready, come get it then, everyone is jealous-
Many want to get friends with them just in case he is relevant
Got iPhone camera lenses to get the Instagram evidence
Yeah, I know I'm way too cocky
But I'm workin', I'm figurin' it all out
So when people say you can't, that makes you wanna get better
That's benefit of the doubt
I've been on the top of this, never droppin' the bottom
It's opposite from the positives, got them from talkin' often
And I'm locked in a pocket of all my thoughts, and they keep turnin' around
Always stoppin' my songs 'cause they keep burnin' the sound, I'm like-
Yeah, this is freedom of speech
Tryna' murder all the people who be keepin' the peace
Sacrifice your whole life 'cause you need a degree
Opportunity in front of you, you need to achieve, I'm like-
Nah, I'm just tryna find some clarity
Apparently, it all has to do with popularity
There will be obstacles, primarily, people blinded to
What is carefully being prepared to me
Sometimes you'll have hilarity, parody, and prosperity
I'm askin' Hillary Clinton to marry me, powerful in the very least

[Verse 11]
Giving you all of my money, but never see legacy every day that I'm meant to see
Everyone here is impaired, it is so scary and menacing, but I know enemy
'Cause I go- uh, walking away, hopping block and what's often the case
Shot in the face, gun locked and loaded, been off at the race, droppin' the bass
Off of the place, brought in a way, predict what I will probably say
And at the end of the day, you still talking to me, so obviously, let the audience say
So let me explain this to those who came in, looking at the stages
Seeing a white kid thinking he's famous, when they don't understand
That I take risks and I make hits, from basic playlist to the greatest
Entertaining the nation, be patient whilst waiting for me to break in

[Verse 12]
-Re-energize, got lyrics to memorize
Start an enterprise of better guys who cannot be successful and never try
That's my dream job, bein' lazy, just sittin'
With the TV on, they say that I'm bright like neon
But I ain't takin' responsibility, pay me for havin'
Limited ability with little humility
But whatever I'm doin', it seems to be killin' me
I'm unwillingly artistically fittin' into this history
Tryna show you why I'm better, but none of you believe me
Tryna win this gold and try hard, good game, gg
You beat me, and now you see me in 3D, but you can't feel me
Showin' up on your device, control/option/delete
Consider myself elite, measure myself in retweets
I be talkin' way more chill so you can reach me
Instead of pretendin' you understand what I am talkin' 'bout
I'm the exhibit you kinda scared for, like a haunted house
Tryna show you something instead of just sittin' on the couch
I'll be honest now, I rarely- end up walkin' out
Into reality, in normality actually happily
Found myself doin' nothing, and you don't laugh at me, why?
'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing
Nothing 'cause for- a brain that is amazing
Not complainin', but the best part of life is not even livin' it
Love sleepin' and just usin' the internet
But my time is limited, and I better figure this
Before I'm slippin' this opportunity, out my fingertips
And let me just tell you what I have came to do
Tryna show you I can rap as fast as I'm able to
Tryna show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo
And say some stupid metaphors and leave after I'm breakin' through
And if a major record label is looking at me
I'm a nice guy with bad teeth, got a nice eye for bad beats
I can rap fast, and rap slow
I may make mistakes but everyone, has, so
I'm like MJ back when he had the afro
Also, I'm not black, so... maybe not
But before everyone gets angry, stop
I'm that person, then people naturally hate me, block
All the people who keep on going crazy off
'Cause I won't be making amazing songs in a mainstream, got
A lot of prominent features, I'm a confident speaker
With some dominant teachers
I deserve to be a starter, but constantly on the bleachers
I'm awfully small-achiever when I'm up on the spot, and eager
They be fearin' this every time that they hearin' it
To know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin' a pyramid
So when you're nearin' this, please let me know
When I'm standin' here frozen, please let it go
Hear the metronome combined in the compilation
To unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation
But that is just a dream, and probably a combination
Of a big ego and false encouragement on the way in
But when I'm playin', just know it's all a big game
I was tryna blow up- bang! Have a big name
But when you think about it, it is all insane
What can be created from chemicals in this brain
But when you look at me, you lackin' respect
When I'm crackin' my neck so that I can rap to my chest
Has in a breath, some say that it's magic, I step
Until I'm on the same stage, and you have it again
But, but when you think about the hall-of-fame
You think about how people used to sit and call you names
And you check and wonder if it will be all the same
Step back into reality, it all remains, damn

[Interlude 3]
Alright, I just spilled water on my computer right now
On my computer-'s breaking while I'm doing this thirty-thousands words shit
Hold on, uh
Goddamn it

[Verse 13]
My lyrics are not showing up on the screen, you knowin' just what I mean
This is off the top, I don't need to use no machines
Hold up, I know I can freestyle, but I can't do it forever
But I am very clever, okay, okay
I'm gonna take a drink, if you're watchin' this, take a drink too
These are some shit' that you can drink to
But drink water unless you're of age
You know what I'm sayin'? Ayy

[Interlude 4]
Okay, okay
Uh
Uh
Ayy

[Verse 14]
I feel like I'm way too different, ridiculous
-Most of humanity's made of idiots
I barely even get myself, and you thinkin' you understand?
You think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper-hand?
Please... what I do is barely poetry
There's hope for me, I'm noticing people starting to notice me
But still consider me confident
Still consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness
But honestly, all of this is haunting me, probably
It is just my sense of myself wobbling, toppling
Into awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin'
It's tragic and not fleetin', it follows me all evening
It's calling my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake
I close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away
Yeah, we're just tryna find that great escape
To get away from how we're living life day-to-day
Some people find it in a drink or in a cup
Or in some bling or in a drug, or in the things that give us love
But all I know is that it's tough
And all I know is that this stuff isn't enough; it's way too much

[Verse 15]
I'm young and ill, like the dictator, man, what I gotta do to make the quick paper?
These kid-haters are like ten years old but still claim to be big players
That shit will make me go, but I'm aiming high, and you aiming low
Got amazing rhymes and a crazy flow, and I may be lyin', but I came to show
What I can do when I get on the mic, and I'm keeping it moving, you said I'm the hype
And I'm seeing it through in successes inside, I don't take it for granted with plans in this life
-Set on the wrong, forgetting the right, like, 2 AM in my head in the lights
Ahead of the best of 'em, lettin' the rest of 'em go off to bed in the night
-Getting it like I be livin' in first class, I know that you never will surpass
-Getting the worst task for this burnt trash whenever I work fast
Remember the memos they sendin' and sendin' again and again  and they never will end it
And say it is splendid, but never relented and every sentence I say is perfected
Take a deep breath, 'cause I need that
Most of y'all don't even care what I'm saying, you really just like how I speak fast
My bars are meta, I got meta bars with meta-eights and metaphors
You want better cores and better cars, but you don't know what I'm headin' towards
Say that I am the king of this shit, crazy rhymes, they ain't thinkin' of this
I'm singin' and rappin', and makin' it happen and makin' you laugh when I'm bringin' this shit
Tryna find the other way, y'all just waiting for another day
'Cause what other fourteen-year-old had hit 100K?
I'm making the most of a crazier flow, so many ways it could go
I'm taking the throne and you chillin' and stayin' at home, I'm willing to make it my own
I'm bakin' my cake, and you know that I'm eating it, even if staying up late is the needed bit
Reason is, stayin' the same, I'm just fleein' it, leavin' my life while I'm seeing these seasons switch
Meaning, these people ain't feelin' rich, reach in the fire, I'm heatin' it
Pleasin' these liars, they've peaked, and so now they're recedin' agreein' to be a live without leading it
Flow's so dope, I think it's time that we take a break
We all make mistakes and play some hate, I got 808s here to save the day
'Cause I am on top of it, lost in my thoughts and I gotta be stoppin' it, rockin' it
You know my flow is so dominant, positive, confident, full of accomplishments, compliments
All of these offers is boring as fuck, though I am not a part of 'em
Start a new part to the charts and I gotta be sure this art is the star on the map when I'm starting it
Breaking it up, like cartilage, flow is so crazy, it's dope and you know it
I know that you hate to admit it, but really, this shit is the business, rhymes keep darkenin'
Under the radar, you don't know what's comin', I'm comin' right up, and your bitch started runnin'
I found to be part of a little of something called love, and I guess that's the art of it
I try to go slow, but it don't work
-Gettin' better, and that don't hurt, and you think I'm dead, and you're sure
You're salty and not kosher, slave to the corporates and the owners
This is live and love, call it Shrek, like the ogre
Hah, bitch, I have had enough, and I am sure I ain't mad enough
Forgettin' the rest while I'm gettin' success, and I look at the numbers, I add 'em up
My chart is like a parabola, thank you a lot for havin' us
And so, every day, I take one step up, man, I am takin' the ladder up
-Hundred K- get the plaque, lookin' forward, not heading back
Remember what I had said is that we ain't givin' up, remember that
Hit me up when you're done whining, I'll hit you up when I'm done rhyming
Listen up, 'cause I'm combining all my skills into one finding
We run, grinding, you know we do, we got the shit that we're goin' through
These lyrics go over you, you  don't listen, so you don't know it's true
'Cause we in, and we've done it, thousands, now we a hundred
Shoutout to Didac and Momo and the others
Shit, I consider them brothers, shit, I consider you all are my family
Shoutout to those who will stand with me, even when all of the others abandon me
Yeah, drama, we move past that, now I look at you with the last laugh
Better trackback, now I rap fast, so many skills in my backpack
Started off so terribly, now all of these people compare to me
In the past, I never anticipated what there would be
And see ya, so long now, off to the end of the song now
See ya next at five-hundred and a million, it's on now

[Interlude 5]
It's on now
Oh shit, I'm almost out of water
This is a hard- this a- real challenge
This like, physically difficult, ayy

[Hook 4]
When I walk up in the scene, I hear a orchestra
Now everybody telling me I don't perform enough
My math teacher told me that I'd never be shit
And now, I'm searched more then the quadratic formula
I got the formula, I got the formula
You got the sauce, but goddamn, I got the formula, ayy
People always asking Ben, ""Why you record so much?""
I got to fry up all these rappers quick, like, order up

[Verse 16]
Formula, like I'm Mr. Krabs
I change and transform it up, you stuck in the past
Yeah, I wear Supreme goggles to my science lab
Uh, it hurts to write this song, 'cause I don't like to brag
And now I've tied myself up, like a Nike Mag'
People love to criticize me for the life I've had
They make it 'bout white and black, like I'm Michael Jack'
I make these haters look confused, like it's Dora asking where Swipper at, ayy
Uh, bitch, I'm supreme, 'cause I got it on me, now they copy that, like a walkie-talkie
And I'm feelin' like they really want to stop me, tryna fold my paper, like it's origami
Wanna justify the hate, they call me cocky, and I am, 'cause your girl call me, 'Papi'
Tryna take ti-t-uh.. paparazzi, I'm a fax machine up in a lot of copies
Ayy, still saying, ""Who would'a thought?"", like, who would'a guessed it?
Haven't lifted weights in two years, but somehow, I'm always flexing
If you really want to find the answer to your question, here is where you should look:
Want the secret to the sauce, motherfucker? Better go and find a cookbook

[Verse 17]
Ayy, they doubt a fucker with a dream
Looking to the stars for some money and a scheme, yeah
Looking at the cars, all the hundreds and the greens
Serpent's told you, ""No,"" and it's like nothing's as it seems
God damn, I guess I really thought he was the man
I guess I really thought he had some fans, but that shit is all a sham
All that cash he stocked was from a scam
All the views he got was from some spam
I've been living like, ""Man, ain't why he been doin' what he can?
Why ain't he just sticking to the plan?
How has he been living with no limits, getting millions by the minutes?""
I don't get it, I don't really understand
I've been living like, ""Damn, he ain't getting money by the 'Gram
I'll do better if I study my exams, do I really wanna stand
Next to all these average fucking sad duds?""
So I hate this motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one

[Hook 5]
Yeah
Hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one
Ayy
Just because you gave up, doesn't mean I'm a backup
Uh, uh, uh
Feel all my good times get replaced by the bad ones
And so they hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he

[Verse 18]
'Cause he been living this passion, I'ma just sit and imagine
I've got a bitch on my lap and she listen to rap, and she really been digging my track, and I'm livin' for Snap
That shit invisible now, I'm unoriginal now
I'm making a- minimum wage, this is literal AIDS, and I'm needin' to figure this out
How did I get to the stage? I wanna get up on stage, do this shit everyday
And I won't care 'bout whatever they say, let 'em all pester away
But I just can't shoot my shot, got a bad gun
So I hate this motherfucker with a dream 'cause he has one

[Verse 19]
By now, if you're still watching this shit
You are a boss and you deserve some applause for this shit
But we ain't over, we ain't done, though
Am I takin' a break? Are you dumb, bro?
Well, we nearin' 10K, but I still need 30K
While all you sit around, I would rather work than play
Lyrics go through your dome, through your vertebrae
Hit you back and forth till you end up at the pearly gates

[Interlude 6]
That was actually a pretty good bar
I just wrote that like, right- a second ago, before I recorded this
Ayy, ayy
You know, just to add some- fill stuff in, uh

[Hook 6]
Sometimes, I don't know what to think
Sometimes, I don't know what'll
Make it okay, make it okay
I'm snorin' all day for dreams, yeah, ayy

[Verse 20]
Uh, I wake up pondering, damn, my mind is wandering
All these opportunities left squandered in my oxygen
All accomplishments left haunted in my lack of confidence
Often is the result of falling under consciousness
You'd make babies cry, I make crazy lives
You're just angry, 'cause you're livin' in a fading lie
And I've been feeling this energy, feeling that somebody's getting the penalty
Fearing that, one day ,you'll end up ahead of me, feeling that this is the end of me
No, will I tell you? No, never- I think I'm so clever
But in the grand scheme of things, I know that I'm no better
But I don't ever
Want to go to show, just one mo' letter
I'm a go-getter, I go get A's and get grades
And get A's, then wake up, and get C's, but get paid
Uh... my life is so unusual
To most, it isn't suitable, to me, it's irrefutable
Can't see me in a cubicle, I'd rather watch my funeral
I'd rather go back to stab my own brains out back in utero
Uh, but you know that I'm capable
You know I'ma pounce at any chance that is available
Feeling so unique and I think it's not explainable
No one hears my lyrics, and says, ""OMG, relatable!""
No, that's not what I'm here to give
Been waiting years for this, you're about to experience
Something that I've spent time, money and thought on
Learned about all the times money had thought wrong
Kinda funny, it's long gone, but time is crummy and not long
I ain't lucky, I'm not calm, not by a long-shot
-Out on the inside, see me on the outside
Always think I'm positive, and never see the downsides
It's 'bout time you know the truth, you couldn't be further from it
Get your head out your own ass, you couldn't be further up it

[Interlude 7]
Okay
Okay, okay, we're like thirty minutes in
Thirty minutes, but we got thirty-thousand, bro
Fuck

[Verse 21]
Yeah, I'm the key to the equation, bitch, you better beware
I'm like the 'e' that equals all other emcees squared
I'm just me, performing in front of empty chairs
But y'all see, so all of y'all better get prepared
I got so much opportunity, I gotta make the most of it
Shoes made of the banana peels, I feel like I'm supposed to slip
Man, in this life, we all climbing unstable ladders
It's not about who goes faster, but it's 'bout the man who'll hold his grip
Damn, I got a crazy ass work ethic
Blocked out south east and west, leave in one direction
I finished my album, and people saying they lovin' it
Fuck with it, but I took it down and redid it to perfection
We all students of rap, but we don't learn lessons
Like a Eskimo's jacket, all them be forgettin'
Wanted to fuck a nun, started like really badly
And I didn't even have to ask for me to get her blessing- that's a horrible bar
Can't stand me 'cause I crossed them up, their ankles hurtin'
Yeah, uh... yeah, yeah, I'm an amazing person
I base my motivation on my favorite angels words a-
-bout how I'ma make it, gettin' famous, man, that thing's for certain

[Verse 22]
You keep your standards low, man, I keep my standards high
Wanna' get on any action, like the Brazzers camera guy
Can't deny I'm fucking insane, sometimes I fantasize
How it would be like to be normal, but I just randomize
And analyze my situations, leaving people paralyzed
And take a step out of bed, meanwhile I'm at my paradise
America is very nice, but I'd like to see the world
But I'd like to get out in to the open and meet my girl

[Verse 23]
In a Mercedes Benz with his lady friends
Crazy Ben is just chillin' with them women, you know they be tens
They be tens or more, they be tens or more
I like to talk to all these people 'cause they marvel at my metaphors
It's free speech, I can say what I want
But these listenin' are tryna make me pay for my talk
They don't like what I'm doin', they don't appreciate the banter
I get it, you're jealous, but listen, 'cause I'm the answer, uh
Motherfucker, I'ma live for the right time
Fuck that, I'ma live for the moment
Sitting here in the middle of the night time
My mind puzzled with the thoughts that be flowin'
Damn, I've been livin' in a headache
Bitches never listenin', they saying that they ready
But I can never believe them
Got these goals and they can never achieve 'em
How can your dreams come true if you ain't willin' to dream 'em?
Damn, that's a lot of shit to think about
Suddenly, company starts to come to me, wondering
What I'm doin', next I realize, that shit, I gotta figure out
Made some beats, I gotta hit 'em out, heh
Got these dreams that I'm livin' out
In my mind's eye, givin' out lots of songs with responses
That I never pictured, wow, damn, damn
This beat's way too holy to rap over
Mental block, my mind's capacities, that's lower
Your raps slower, they lack closure, they lack substance
Like a printer without toner, y'all fillin' pages that have nothin'
Ooh, but I have got somethin' to tell you
I ain't got some money or bullshit to sell you
Speakin' from late nights, I'm thinkin' of Drake's life
Watching these interviews, thinkin' one day I might
Be on that stage right beside all these players
Shit's up to me, I won't hide it in prayers
I'll prove it in music I use to influence
I do this way harder than people assumin'
Resumin' my writin', viewin' this lightin'
That puts me to be in the view of the hidin'
I do what they're likin', but that makes 'em hate me
No matter what I do, they just mistake the
Reason I'm flowin', the reason I start up
Not just for the fame, and the money, the star bucks
And- damn, I ain't talking about the coffee place
Most to these rappers only write this shit using copy/paste
I'd have made a lot of songs that go to waste, uh
I just need a home run, I already loaded bases
I have got so many cases
Been visiting, living in so many places
Experiences that I made me to Emmy
Ben, B-E-N, please, I hope you let me
Be me, I ain't greedy or needy
Believe me, I just want to be on your TV
Get on my level, 'cause I need a new staircase
Damn, yeah, I've been looking at their space
And, one day, I'll be there
I know what I'm doin', I'm already prepared

[Verse 24]
I've been waiting like thirty-thousand years
Tryna make the world listen, so make sure that you can hear
I'm trying to take a passion out of turning my career
I'm concerned without my fear, but I earned it, and I'm here
Now I earned it, and I'm here to stay
I'm coming in, you're trying to clear the way, another chance, another fucking year to play
Not even seventeen, eighteen, I'm so near to fame
Not really, look at all the shit, I just hear this day
I don't know- I look at the future nostalgically
I'd cure every disease, and y'all still wouldn't be proud of me
Undoubtably know how to be what I am about to be
To say that money talks, and that shit seems so damn loud to me

[Verse 25]
Recently, I have been feeling alienated
My songs out of this world, people claim that aliens made 'em
But, baby, I'm crazy, don't hate me- don't hate me 'cause I'm different
Hate me because you hate me, then maybe we can live with it

[Verse 26]
People say that this is the biggest thing to hop on the screen
All will scream, overreacting, like it's a drama scene
Y'all are mean, and since the best quality is honesty
Promise me that it's the reality, where's Keanu Reeves?
Trapped in a Matrix, it's how I felt sometimes back in the ages
When I would rap on the stages, and now, I laugh at those days, and
I'm moving on, grooving while you lose the song
Move along, nothing to see here except some stupid pawns
Who could bomb this whole place up with one great lung?
One great tongue, I am that one great one
On vacation, I vacate to a location
Far away from where people just may run
A light to go to where there is no one, no one, no fun
Oh, son, I'm tryna be me, and so young
I can murder this beat with no gun, go run
I've too many problems to handle, here, hold one
I just hop onto the rap boat, but that ship has now sunks
And now, punks can make loud junk, Uptown Funk
Was a great song, catchy at first, but that radio station
Playing it, making it just get to the worst
My head's gonna burst if I hear it again, and I'm sure
I'll throw my speakers on the ground, denting the earth
And now, I'm ending this verse, and I mean it
Now the ink of this pen just keeps on bleeding, yeah

[Verse 27]
Good rappers never get to see the light of day
But when you selling sex and a gimmick, they'll sign you right away
I'll obey... nah, whatever, man, what is this?
I'm rapping so fast to the max, and I'm playing my tracks so that people will know I mean business
Nobody witness anything better than when I am showing you this shit
Know I'm suspicious, because I'll be flowing and growing like, ""Oh, this kid is big""
Know how I live it, go on a mission, y'all better listen
Till I'm ahead of this shit by all of the inches, 'eah
And when I'm, uh... I'm telling y'all that I got a story
God ignores me, stop the glory, cop is for me in auditory
Not visually, typically, the original me
So unforgivable, so inexplicable, obvious the pinnacle digitally
Damn, that was fast, felt so jammed till I unpacked
And I'm just tryna prove to you the things that I can move on the track
And I'm trying to get a record deal, never ever felt so real
Whenever we're the guests to feel, whenever f-this gets to feel
So different, and I'm loving it, time to change and discover it
Time to make a difference, and I'm living it, so I'm up for it
I always talk to them other kids, them other kids couldn't understand me
One path, making a knot, ain't gonna stop for plan B

[Interlude 9]
I wrote that one a long time ago
That was the first time that I looked- that I- I looked at those again
But you know, I still- I'm not that rusty, not that rusty
I- actually... classic!

[Verse 28]
We just living in the solar system
One big world here to hold the wisdom
One big jail to control the victims
We're all here, tryna find a soul in rhythm
A voice in writing and a choice deciding
Whether or not to follow what the boys are likin'
What the girls are doing, what we gotta be exposed to
Think about who you are, and it's so true
Think about the people who you think have really known you
Do they really know you? Do you even know you?
Damn, that shit is like a Jaden Smith tweet
Sometimes you gotta think 'bout how crazy shit be
And lately, it seems to make the extremes
So prominent and dominant in making big dreams
I'm seeing aliens scream
When I go to sleep, man, my brain needs fixing
But I'm just tryna make it in life
Fuck you to people who be saying it like
I ain't making it right? Take a vacation and hike
I'm chilled out, bitches, getting famous despite
The fact that I'm young and little bit nerdy
And I know a lot of people would consider me early
I'm just a little kid working tryna configure my searches
Tryna deliver my purpose, and take a shit on my burdens
I'm just me, no, I ain't a victim to hurting
I just see all the people living and burning
So be free, time to be a little bit nervous
It don't matter if you're scared, 'cause this shit is disturbing
And I get it, I don't wanna ever forget it
Guessin' I'm headed towards the ending, and I know it is splendid
So I'll see ya 'round, underachievers
Hop on my wagon, 'cause we dragging late, we gotta be leaving, man

[Hook 8]
So basically, I do this for fun, they ain't making me
I'm tryna have a blast, 'cause we growing so fast, we be getting my career from A to Z
And, basically, I'm great you see, I made my life at the age of three
But now, what am I meant to do when my own fanbase are hating me?

[Verse 29]
I've been see' 'ple- misusing their fans, like crooks
Manipulating their audience to catch that hook
They'll believe anything that you'll tell them, look-
You can feed them shit so you can sell your book, haha
But no shots fired, though
Nothing wrong with a little bit of lying though
I mean... look at Fox News
That's the whole premise of their entire show
But no political shit, I always do just enough, I'm a minimalist
Makin the most of my minimums, winnin' 'em, got a couple of synonyms to help you listen to original bits
I got a lot of digital prints, man, your own homedog is a literal bitch
But I'm filling the syllables, it's a little predictable, 'cause I've written this shit for all of the cynical kids
I got time! Maybe a little too much of it
But you know that I'm tryna move up a bit
People look at me and say my potential has
Got a big max, and you know that I'm lovin' it
So fire, can't handle me with oven mitts
Underground, blessed if you discovered it
Flow is so unique, I got so much to do
Not like any other kid

[Hook 9]
Ayy, yo, what you say, though?
Yeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, though
Yeah, when I walk out in the town, I gotta stay low
You know I'm comin' to them checks like Usain Bolt

[Verse 30]
Wait so, inhale the fumes while I paint this
Picture: me, I'm sitting in my room and I'm anxious
Tryna make my moves while they huge and they famous
I knew this shit I couldn't do, I was jaded
Now, somehow, I'm next up, yeah, I'm blessed up
Now I wake up and I'm fly, I don't dress up
Now I'm fly and my opponents better catch up
I get my checks, uh, all y'all need to step up
I-I-I-I-I-I- remember tryna practice my cadence
In tracks I was makin', I had to be patient
Everybody said that shit was trash, and they were right
But I turned that shit and made a right, shit is day and night
Now I gotta take a flight to Vegas, might not stay the night
Everybody see me eatin', now they wanna take a bite
So I'm like, ""Okay... no way""
Yeah, when it comes to this shit, man, I don't play
I'm like Houdini in my Ghost, you can't see me, I'm gone
Ball so hard, I gotta wear my Yeezys to prom
YouTube bitches asking me to retweet they song
I'm the reason people got Spotify Premium on

[Hook 9]
Like, ayy, yo, what you say, though?
Yeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, though
Yeah, when I walk out in the town, I gotta stay low
You know I'm runnin' to them checks like Usain Bolt

[Verse 31]
So I'm like okay, nah, no way
When it comes to that shit, man, I don't play
If you ask me how I got it I will say
I got the drive, yeah, really get out of the roadway, uh

[Interlude 8]
Damn
Some of these
Are too slow and also too fast
Whatever

[Verse 31]
I'm out of order, three hoes like I'm Santa Claus
Pull up on your bitch, Bape hoodie with a camouflage
Hey now, yo, what's the play now?
I'm tryna slide, I ain't talkin' 'bout a playground
Yeah, I remember all them days I would stay down
20K's chillin' in my PayPal
So what the fuck you wanna say- you wanna say now? Nothin'
Best in my town and that's no discussion
Humble beginnings, ain't humble, we winnin'
If I wanna brag, that's my humble decision
Everything I do is goin' off
So if I wanna freestyle, then you better know the cost, ayy

[Interlude 10]
I think she blocked me
Damn
There's no more water, I'm literally about to die

[Hook 9]
I think she blocked me on the Instagram
I need to know, what did I do? I guess I missed your plan
Me, I'm just searchin' for that truest shit, where is it, man?
I'll never know, just wanted you to help me understand
I need some closure because, truthfully, I give a damn, I give a damn
Plenty of fish in the sea, but see, I ain't no fisherman
See, I'm a middleman, a businessman, and this means business, man
Diggin' in the sand, lookin for a reason, I'm not kiddin', man

[Verse 32]
How am I gonna let all of this get to me?
Been a few months since you texted me
Shit, I'll just tell myself I'm a celebrity
Ain't no way that this can get to me
And in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter
But right now, it's feeling like everything
The more I talk about it, it just gets sadder
'Member thinkin' about a wedding ring
But now I'm thinkin' 'bout so many things
What did I do to deserve it?
This shit the most petty of petty things
I'll stick with how nobody's perfect
Like all of my life, I'll forget about it
And all of the things that I said about it
But why the fuck did I get blocked?
I just cannot wrap my head around it

[Interlude 11]
I just can't wrap my head around it
Now I'm just getting bored, I'm just fuckin' up all the flows
Just for the fun of it
If you're still watchin' this shit, uh, comment, uh...
Comment ""Arrowhead water"" in the comments
And let me know what-what would you rate this out of ten
Give me a rating, that way know that you're real-
That you're real one, you know what I'm sayin'? Alright, here we go

[Verse 33]
Spectacular speculations
-Havin' some reservations
Imaginin' all the statements
-Travellin' through these places
Back in, then buy some passionate
Trashin' of reputations
They actually don't have facts, and
Reality left them baseless
I wish that we left 'em nameless
-'Sociate 'em with faces
Make judgments from expectations
And watch as their heads are shaking
-People want me to crumble
And turn to some medication
To fuck up my motivation
And focus on education

[Hook 10]
But I'm petty, petty, petty, petty
That's all they really ever tell me
So many times that you convince me of shit
That I swear you could've won an Emmy
I got a phone in my hand, like a note for the 'Gram
And I'm thinkin' about holdin' your hand, but you don't understand
I think t' 'ove is eith-either gold or a scam
And you never really know till the end, like, how all this began

[Verse 34]
I've been comin' at this as a man
Trying to figure out where I fit into the plan
How does all the drama surround me? I hear 'em followin' loudly
And I don't wanna hear about this shit again
I guess that's the way it goes when they stalk me
And do anything to try and stop me
I did nothing wrong, but that's how it goes
When a basic bitch try to block me, uh

[Verse 35]
Livin' life, but you're stayin' the same
How you expect yourself to go take the fame
Make your name, but you don't take the pain
You wanna be unique but not make a change
Like, what? How you expect to go through this
Think about the goals, man, why you wanna do this
So stupid and useless if you never lose it
Risk yourself a little for the movement- when did I write-
This ain't the Ode to Joy, this the ode to success
Don't know if there is a God, but I know that I'm blessed
And I'm open to ""No"" and I'm open to ""Yes""
I'll do whatever I can to go to the best
That will go to the right and go to the left
No doubt I'ma show up at night instead of goin' to bed
When I know that I'm right, I'm explodin' my chest
I keep on loadin' the time and it goes over my head
I think ""No, why do I even try these things?
I need shiny things like diamond rings
And flying rings and pricey bling- uh
That is what drives these strings
I'm so- I'm so lively and lazy at the same time
Sayin' somethin' sane and crazy in the same rhyme
Never go to practice, don't phase me till it's gametime
Learnin' this life will amaze me, how I made my
Day, find a minute, I'm livin', winnin' and willin'
To spit rhythm and chillin', they get so pissed with me, I'm either villain
No, they not kiddin', and no, I'm not quittin', I know I'm just sittin'
Sittin' with a dream, and maybe
Maybe just see then, see then where the dream could take me
But I know it can't, I know it takes luck, I'm angry!
Why am I just the B of the A-team
At the feet of the mainstream? Man, I dream for this daydream!
Uh, and I believe that I'm makin'
Cease for the takin', it's me in the train, and
I see that I'm breakin', my knees aren't place and
I keep on thinkin' that I'm being amazin'
But I'm improvin', I know it's just a slow climb
Pushin' myself, yeah, I'll be there in no time
So I'm movin', I'm movin' till I get there
Get where? I just don't want to get left there

[Interlude 12]
I don't remember
I don't even know what that's from but that was written in there
It's been a lot of late nights, okay?

[Hook 11]
I don't give a fuck about anything
Skinny white child on the track, but I'm threatening, they don't wanna let 'em in
They told me if I take it, I'll feel better, like it's medicine
But I ain't settling, they tryna rush me, like adrenaline

[Verse 36]
And labels don't reply so I can get a deal
I've been itchin' for this shit, someone give me a Benadryl
I get hella skill, man, they worried that I never will
Have success in bills, man, the grill- haha seven mill'
I don't give a fuck about this shit, I've been goin' overboard and now they jumpin' on the ship
Man, they hypocrites, pimpin' they butterflies while they in- okay, that one was work, uh
And want my Christmas as a Christmas gift
Middle child, know I'm anythin' but in the middle, bitch
Man, I don't give a shit, I'm well behaved, and so articulate
I'm the type to ask my fucking teacher for a syllabus
Uh, uh
Existential crisis, every day I think I don't exist
Chicken little, I'm a fryin' pan, I'm a dyin' man
Wake up every mornin', I'ma make a fuckin' diagram
And find a plan to be the highest man in this giant land
Rap so fuckin' hard, I think I'm injurin' my diaphragm
Iron Man, think I'm Iron Man
Kids be puttin' fire emojis on my entire 'Gram, I'm a fireman
Second grade teacher got me singin' in the choir, man
And look at where I am, I never thought I would acquire fans
Acquire bands, say a bunch of random shit and rhyme it, man
That's how much I do not give a fuck, let's go to Ireland
Hundred grand on those rubber bands to hold your fuckin' bands
Listening to the cash register like your fuckin' jam
-Don't understand, like a Republican with a gun in his hand
Sayin' that ""Trump is the man to come with the plan"", livin' in wonderland
That shit is a fucking scam
Making America show that it's dumb again, ha! Ha...

[Verse 37]
They told me I needed to do a switch up
My friends told me I needed to get my hits up
It ain't that simple, I'm not someone that white teenagers wanna be like
I can't say ""Issa"" in a meme and have it pick up
Big up, I'm a transnational British person
Dimension C-137's my biggest version
I've been disturbin', music it isn't listed as urban
Air quotes next to my name in red caps, written as burden
I'm a fuckin' burden to every fuckin' person on this Earth, man
I'm determined, I'm tryna get it workin'
Sortin' out pins and needles like an amateur surgeon, that makes no sense
All these listeners are so dense
This song is conversational, so why you still talkin' to me?
I email artists, they haven't responded to me
My camera just went out, so why you still talkin' to me? Uh
I'm trying to give you free money, not fond of your feat
I'm tryna to make a deal, not call the police
I have free publicity, they don't want to be seen
I guess they don't wanna be seen, fuck these monopoly scenes
Uh, yeah, they collab with rappers with fifty plays
I hit 'em up about it and wait sixty days
Now I'm bigger than these rappers I'm askin'
I hit 'em up again, and then I never get a response, damn
What the fuck is happenin'? Damn

[Hook 12]
I said f-
Fuck a lawsuit, fuck a lawsuit, ayy
What'd it cost me is what it cost you, ayy
G-Gotta stop you, y'all are not cute, uh
No need to argue, 'cause I do not lose, ayy, uh

[Verse 38]
Who's your momma? I need to know who taught you, I need to
'Call you believe, but I'm sure that nobody believes you
I'm makin'-I'm makin' music, as soon as I start makin' money, you tryin' to review
You gonna claim every verse on my album, are you gonna claim these too?
'Cause I am independent, you a little jealous, and you skeptical of how I'm really sellin'
You assumin' that I can't legit defend it, I'ma send you out here with a prison sentence
Copyright-abusin' pricks, tryin' to profit off my music shit
Little do you know that I am not afraid of you, and so I will refuse to quit, you stupid bitch
I'm bad for real, my shit got mass appeal, ayy
Every song that I drop is an anthem, you don't really have to kneel, damn
Freestyle, you don't have to steal, don't like it? Well, you have to deal, damn
If I say it that it's how I feel, it's real, I don't pass no drill, damn
Plug called like we had a deal, man, this shit ain't daffodils, damn
When it all comes d- at my door, get the fl- 'oy like a Happy Meal, ayy
If it does, then I have to kill, name a track like the- you pass a d'ill-
Haha, to 'hi-, killer, bum-uh-dum-num, damn, I have to chill
Yeah, this a new wave, y'all are too late
You say you gon' start tomorrow, well, tomorrow's today
I get-I get all these bags, stuff 'em in a suitcase
You a thief, you be stealin' flows like you Boonk Gang

[Interlude 13]
I accidentally quit out all these lyrics
So I was just trying to piece it together like a puzzle
You know what I'm saying? Ayy
Let's gom random shit, ayy

[Verse 39]
I take no credit for anything that I do
That's how I live life with a positive attitude
That's why I've seem pissed, but I'm never gettin' mad at you
That's the reason that people mirror my attributes
What I contribute to the world is
Some crazy shit nobody else's world did
And I'm just tryin' to spread some peaces love
But, man, it's really hard, 'cause you need some luck
I've been waitin', 'cause this is
The best time for me to be layin' out of business, uh
And I'm breathin' in the air, but it all tastes tainted
When all of this time is wasted, really ain't wasted

[Interlude 14]
This is trash, I have- don't know when I wrote this
I think I wrote this in like 2013, this is how far back I-
This is how far back we are, I'm not even gonna rap this
Let's do something else- oh, okay, let's do this

[Verse 40]
It's bumpin', bumpin', this beat is just so disgustin'
You leavin' me in the lust of my meet-and-greet for my lovin'
I'm enchanted, damn, this beat is just full of somethin'
That's makin' me want to get up, and breath in all the percussion
Man, I'm dancing, dancing, man, I'm feelin' the rhythm
Droppin' my head, fancy snares, then when it hits 'em
It really gets in my bloodstream, life just makes sense to me
Bass and a good groove is really a great recipe
Can't mess with me, no one- feelin' too good in the moment
Feelin' new when I go in, and feelin' blue when it's over
And I'm noddin' yes, and then I am applaudin' next
And then, I'm tryna to mentally send God a text
Like, ""Hey, what's up, God? I don't know if you're real
But, listen to how this bumps, you supposedly feel
Like a god‚Äî well, you get what I'm sayin'?""
And goddamn, I just can't really express when I'm playing

[Hook]
I said it's bumpin', uh- y'all just go for a ride
We feelin' good at the top, man, we more than high
Yeah, we be feelin' it, know that this the realest shit
All the pain, this is healin' it, love it, I'm never leavin' it
It's bumpin'

[Verse 41]
Really, this is bumpin' to me
You ain't feelin' it, so then you just get up and you leave
But this is something to me, so don't come runnin' to me
I said we comin' in this shit like we be fuckin' the dream
No, never mind, probably not
But I constantly got energy that's lost in my thoughts
And I'm not gonna stop, and yes, this may be costing a lot
But lookin' at the end result, man, we've accomplished a lot
And no, I'm not gonna regret a thing after this, I'm still trying to master this
'Cause now, I'm known as that weird-ass rappin' kid
The fact of it is that it is really just a giant hobby
Something for me to be original, not a lyin' copy
Tryna make some shit where you can really get your head nodding
Verses so fire that- 's when it's done, it's- left sobbing
Blah, blah, blah, it's uh- we just a work-in-progress
Some of my shit means shit and other words are nonsense
But now we easin' up, we got a beat that's bumpin'
See me stuntin' while I'm flowin', we adjustin', see me bluffin'
Every day, man, see me bluffin', that is what I do
Listen to some good shit, tryna make a substitute
I got so much stuff to do, and I am just a youngin' too
Who just hopped on the scene? Everybody wonders who
But all I know is that we find a safety in rhythm
And that is the reason that I am making a shipment
I said it's bumpin'

[Interlude 15]
Nearin'- we're nearin' an hour
If you're still watchin' this shit, I love you, I actually, like, love you
Long time, okay

[Hook 13]
I said, I'm married to the game, but I only just met her
Hopin' that my shit get better, but I'm just gonna
Move with it, ride with it
It's my life, the only burden is the time limit
Fuck it, I'm livin', ayy, I said, ""Fuck it, I'm livin'""
People getting mad, just because, yeah, I'm winnin'
Just because, yeah, I'm winnin', they're stuck-up, and I get it
Just because your life stucks, stop corrupting mine with it
I messed-I messed up the punchline, it's actually really good
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, ayy
Ayy, ayy, uh
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, uh

[Verse 42]
And how am I meant to keep my workflow up?
If a girl shows up, all my world blows up
I'm just sittin' and waitin', instead of becomin' the greatest
Tryna find a brand new motherfuckin' deal
All you bitches fake, all my numbers real
All my shit is punchin' in your stomach, like a meal
Am I married to the game if I can't afford a ring?
It's all very much the same if I can't afford to sing
Now, it's scary for a king, damn, I said, it's scary for a king, even
They call me odd, but I bring even
I bring reason to believe, and you're eatin' it up for free, and
The meaning is rarely seen and no line can be drawn between 'em, I don't show seasons
Yeah, I am me no matter what, and that can grow pleasin'
I'm barely close to anybody, I don't know people
Man, I don't know people who so equal
I don't know nobody who doesn't own evil
Man, that is just a truth and a lie
A truth and a lie, somethin' like the blue in the sky
Or a suit and a tie, yeah, I'm new to this life, I'm new to my mind
New to the time, man, I'm like the proof in disguise
And uh, I'm- lookin' at all of this shit
Oh, you should know I'm not fallin' for this
You get discouraged for one minute
And the next one, you be callin' it quits
And I'll probably get rich If I focus enough
You close-minded, let's open it up
And all of these people assumin' 'bout what I be doin'
But they do not know what is up
Uh, I just wish
That they'd go away
And I won't obey
No, I will never ever show the way
And I will try to mask it up
With other jokes on fucking jokes
Always playin' G'
But now I'm movin' onto other notes

[Interlude 16]
My voice is fucking hurting
It's hurting a lot, I'm not- I haven't had vocal training
So I don't know how to- just do this for a long period of time
Without causing damage to my vocal cords, but who gives a fuck?
Man, I just live it up
I'm gonna go a little bit quieter now
Uh-huh
Yeah

[Chorus 1]
All of these people keep on changin'
All of these times and different phases
All of these lights on all these stages
All of these sights is so amazing
Yeah, I've seen at least a million faces
A million times, a million places
But when it's all said and done
I look and I wonder why, uh

[Verse 43]
Everyone knows that it's so amazing
All the support is my motivation
Compared to the big people at the Capital
My name is spelt in lower cases
People loved me before I made it
People liked it before they watched it
I'm wantin' way too much more than I have
And I'm glad, because now, I will never stop it
Man on a mission, and I g- vision
Of talking a lot of wisdom, man, I gotta listen
Gotta follow and be the leader, and tomorrow
I'll be the teacher when they need the feature
Got flow, and it's so damn crazy
People consider me so amazing
I'm holding control and then folding them verses
It hurts because I am on loaded bases
Advanced shit, I know the basics
Already know them, they're overrated
Meanwhile, I am not rated at all, so we hopin'
'Cause now I am open for game, and
I'm charged up
I ain't Drake, but I'm on the worst behavior
So many people they know the players
Don't know the game and don't know the makers
Don't know the fakers, but who cares?
I'm not here to cater, I'm here to improve and show that I'm greater
I'm here to go move and just go on the layers
And bitch, I am going so later
I got time
My own lyrics, I got mine
And I'm on time for the wrong lines
And I'm not crying, so let's start grinding, let's go

[Hook 14]
I've been all on my own
All on my own, people keep calling my phone
Wanting to know when I'll be the star of the show
But I'm all my own, yeah
And I don't want to talk about it, stop to doubt it
'Cause the world is awfully crowded, but-
The ghost of me is haunting the throne
So I'll make it there all on my own

[Verse 44]
My intermission is mixing with intermissions
And following intuition conflicting with my decision
And it is more than just business, 'cause this is for self-approval
And it is to make it look like I'm living for something useful
And it's sad, but you know it's true for most of you
Appearances distracting from the goals that you should go pursue, the growing movement
To a new type of thing that you can gain from
To push away the past and the places that you came from
Day one for me was like six months ago-

[Interlude 17]
Oh, holy shit!
I actually reached the end of the beat
But I still have, like
Ten-thousand more words
Hold on, I gotta pause this
Hold on, three, it's still one take

[Verse 45]
-Past and the places that you came from
Day one for me was like six months ago
Look at where we been, but imagine where one can go
It's not fun to know that we just livin' to die
It's not fun to know that we just livin' to die
We now know how much money you can give for a lie
Give for a look, but how much can you give for an eye?
What's the point of feeling shit if you just living to cry?
So, get your ass up, 'cause it's time to make it happen
Always been shitty at rappin', but I practice for the passion, man

[Hook 15]
Yeah, I've been living life all on my own, bitch
Uh, I ain't the star of the show, bitch

[Verse 46]
I know like four people who truly respect the grind
And it's usually left to climb in a newly perfected rhyme
And then if time is money then free time ain't really free
And all my fan' pissed 'cause my own lyrics ain't really me
-Stemming from a branch of a wishlist on my Christmas tree
I want to be what's taunting me, but sorry, I'm a mini-me
In the face of my full potential, that is the biggest me
Bigger than you, bigger than anybody in history
The challenge is a challenge, the fact that you got to maximize
To satisfy your lavish life and have a crazy magic time
And luckily, I'm so damn young, 'cause, man, I have the time
To learn from my mistakes and grow into a mastermind
I'm trying to master my craft, and the problem is that I've got
Several different things to potentially make my job
I want to make the MLS, and also have a mili' subs
And also get a mili' plays, and maybe make a mili' bucks
A million- shit, all we ever want is more, really
And once I get three million, I want four milli'
It's so silly, it's so tricky, this whole cycle
We can never be happy, but that is so vital

[Interlude 18]
Uh
Those are actually some good lyrics, uh

[Verse 47]
Rebirth, feet hit the earth, my knees hurt
They're weaker than previously, her
Breathing seems to be burnt like free CDs were
Before we could be searched, I'm like ""Please, just please work""
Like a lenient slave owner‚Äî that's edgy, like gravestones, oh, you get me
I saved dough for a Bentley, t'ere more than a Chevy
I play- I play-
-Who cares about flexin' if you ain't holding it heavy?
Uh, I've been tryin' to prove to all of the people I knew who didn't like what I do
Disgusted like, ""Ew"", yeah, this shit goes outta you, plans have now all become true
I'm seeing them through, man, that's the reason I do, all of the things that I do
It's not for a crew, not for a god or a demon, I've really been needing a clue
Fillin' these shoes, reading these pieces and news, damn, this shit really is screwed
It gives me the blues whenever I'm shielding my eyes from the darkness and don't get a view, uh
But if ignorance is really bliss, then why this ignorance be killin' kids?
And why this ignorance that's clearly vicious is not given shit and ends up innocent?
That shit really is ridiculous, it's magnificently fucked up
But nobody wants to tough it up, I haven't seen it goin' down, it's comin' up
L‚Äî

[Verse 48]
‚Äîcay to the Vatican, havin' them
Good times and bad times with New Romans, do that again, well, that was when
I was so young, too young to really know fun
But so what? I guess that's what happens when you grow up
Dry your eyes and wipe your nose up
Just keep drinking till you throw up, no, we won't judge
But we all just want to be loved and somehow get validated by those we hate
Such a twisted system that we've been given to operate
I've been really thinkin' and figurin' out who's not a fake
Wash away the thoughts I made along the way, it all has changed
Yeah, and now we lookin', it's so far away
And it's so far away

[Hook 16]
This a civil war
It's a fuckin' civil war
Yeah, we be aimin' to the peace
So what we killin' for?
Yeah, anymore
What we even livin' for?
Yeah, they be murderin' for peace
That is a civil war

[Verse 49]
You know- you know they be lookin' at me right now
Like the sewer system, they about to pipe down
I've been writin' my essays, my webpage
Yeah, I call that a new construction site now
Blue's Clues, man, I think I gotta find out
All these questions, man, I really wanna hide out
Or I wanna drop out, maybe learn a lot 'bout
My shit before I wait to see it die out
Damn, I-I just wanna go along
I'm holdin' strong, I know- I know I'm not the boldest one
I'm old enough, I'm growin' up, bars so sick, they throwin' up
They know what's up, now, I'm in the- now I'm really doin' the
Doin' in the big leagues like I got drafted
Before the year-round hype over March Madness
Wanna get it to where these girls strippin' down
Like it's no big deal, like we takin' liberal arts classes
They be sayin', ""Damn, Ben really got savage""
No, but unlike you, I am not average-

[Interlude 19]
Hold on, I have to fix this fucking instrumental
This is so mental, hold on, I have to fix it real quick
I'm gonna fix it, take a pause
Uh, yeah, ayy

[Verse 50]
I'm addicted to the screen and the validations
Of people who are thirteen in another nation
I've been looking for acceptance in the message
Or a comment on a video, it seems to be wasted
Like Internet track meets, they erased it
Look at this shit, I've just recently made it
That how it goes when I'm beatin' and breathin'
Acheivin' and keep on succeedin', they hate it
Y'all lousy and can't breathe all that smoke, bro
You doubt me, but you'll see where I go, so
Allow me to break free from my own dome
To get out and be me, believe in my own zone
Things become intense in the heat of the ozone
It's surroundin' me, I need to go home, so
Can I pretty please just be al-alone?
Nobody to retweet, delete on my home phone
I ain't gon'-I ain't gon' hop on that drug shit
When they all claimin' they love it, uh
I ain't gon' hop on that loud shit
When I know I ain't about it, uh
Yeah, they cannot take this away now
They have something to say now
You cannot order this shit on a takeout
All of these bitches is fake now

[Verse 51]
‚ÄîMy clothes is Japanese, I wear it casually
And I'm a killer on the mic, might cause a couple casualties
-All I'm needin' is a beat to make your fuckin' salary
Man, I said, ""Fuck the peanut gallery, I got a fuckin' allergy""
Trappin' out my PayPal, make it Friends and Family
Now I'm so hot, I need some oven mitts, ain't safe to handle me
Now I made my checks from Spotify, they pay me handsomely
I got the mic up to my brain to help maintain my sanity, okay
Everybody 'round me, they been wasting my time, ayy
Pull up to the functions, see they face when I rhyme, ayy
Everyone's a critic on my case all the time
Do it by myself, I don't need a way to get signed

[Hook 17]
Bitch, I'm clouted up, yeah, I'm clouted up, ayy
Get my numbers up, gotta add 'em up, ayy
Until I get it, I ain't never packin' up, no
And they all comin' for my blood like Dracula, ayy

[Verse 52]
Okay, I'm backin' this, not maskin' shit, now everybody wanna go package shit
I don't give a fuck, you know I'm abstinent, I'ma fuck the whole game up on accident
Wait a minute, shit, I'm too passionate, so they stand up for my anthems, no Kaepernick
'Member when they used to all laugh at this, now they hit me up like, ""What the fuck's happenin'?
Yeah, I had to sacrifice a lot of sleep
Because a lot of people want a lot from me
Yeah, standing in the way of who I wanna be
Now random strangers recognize me when I cross the street

[Verse 53]
So many memories, do you remember these
Moments way back in the time?
Trapped in the back of my mind
I am so happy to grind, I am so happy to find
So much experience now that I'm passing the lines
Now that I'm grasping the signs
I have been laughing a lot, got nothing to hide
No, I've got nothing to hide
Bitch, I am stuck, left behind
I need a drive, yeah, I need something to ride
Fill my own bank account, shit that I'm making now
Puttin' it off to the side
Feeling alive, yes, I am breathing the air
And I'm feeling so careless, but I can't
Let go
Damn
Every morning
I'm wanting to drop out
But I can't stop now
I put too much work in this shit to go pop out
So I walk down five different paths every day
Just need the one, it's only begun
No, I'm not going away
No, I'm not gonna- 's uh- say
That this shit is going badly at all
I'm glad that I fall
I love the ref, but I am mad at the call
I'm mad at the call
Yeah, I'm having it all, I'm traveling far
And I'm practicing hard
Never goin' back to the start, never goin' back to the start

[Verse 54]
Uh, yeah
Putting my mind on the table
No, I am so able, I'm lining the cables
I got the horsepower, but tied to the stables, get by with no label
I do the mixing and mastering
Writing and rapping and making it happen, I'm
Eating my cake, and I'm having it
Real emotion, I'm tapping in, passionate
And I am working my hardest
It's already started, yes, I am being an artist
I'm feeling the largest
I'm feeling the largest

[Part III]

[Intro 3]
Oh!
Is that the final beat change up?
Alright, we were on that last beat for like an hour
For lit- literally an hour... um..
But you know what? Gotta hop on this classic beat, ayy
Uh
Yeah
Had to change it for all you that have been watching till
Till the end, you know?
You didn't think that beat was ever gonna change, but it did, though
Uh, yeah
Ayy

[Verse 55]
Recently, I've been feeling my lyrics missing meaning
I'm trying to whitewash how much they stink like I'm Listerine-ing
Damn, I'm feeling like I've missed the key, and
So I guess that DJ Khaled is always skipping me
But, yeah, you know I'm tryn  do what I can
But these ignorant idiots just can't understand
Yeah, you know I'm tryn  do what I can
But these ignorant idiots just can't understand
I got new crews and the new friends, got new views in a new lens
I'm the new dude, I'm the new Ben, got my YouTube with the new trends
But the way I'm growing is so unorthodox
How could I be connecting them if I have yet to sort the dots?
Sorta lost and very found at the same time
I pour the cost, now I'm very loud in a daytime
And very quiet at night- seem to shine when I write
And I'm longin' to be a five-year-old, chillin', flyin' a kite
And I admire the sight of somebody else workin' more than me
I've been staying grounded, but the sky is movin' towards my feet
And fortunately, I'm on course, living morally
Grinding to get what's rightfully mine, I'm headed right for my dream
Damn, I guess that's all I need to know for now
They put me in the driver's seat, no way I'm slowing down
They know me now but don't know my sound, it is so profound
Give m- two years and I'll make it, let me show you how
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 56]
I gotta stop all of this bragging shit
So many haters, S.M.H. is the acronym
I'm tryna get a couple ""OMG""'s
Or a, ""WTF, he is so sexy""
I got no Bentley, beat is so deadly
Walked up to the rap club, no entry
And I feel a little like I won't get seen
'Cause I'm so white, won't fight, don't get me
'Cause I'm coming at this music with a different set of ideas
Trying to bring my own crib like it's Ikea
Here's a pro-tip: take no tips
From people who aren't pros yet, bitches always so stressed
Damn, 'cause they trying to find that great escape
Nation of dreamers who all just trying to stay awake
Every day, I be waking up to my 808s
Day-to-day hustle, I'm just trying to pave a way
People with the problems always give the most advice
Like, why don't you sort your own life? Don't come close to mine
I'm mostly fine, so please leave me alone to whine
And next time that you're talking shit, please bring me an open mind
'Cause people locking they own ideas in straitjackets
I'm David Blaine's magic- helping you break past it
I'm trying to raise havoc, not trying to stay savage
Trying to make balance while finding a great passion
Climbing to get up this- witnessin' injustice
By who people in love with or based off of skin colors-
Shit is so disgusting- seeing it in public
I'm trying to make sense of it here in the discussions-
Close my eyes and go to sleep, waiting until they notice me
Wait until my creations are making everything so complete
My thoughts are scattered- find lots of patterns
I try not to let it get my plots in ashes

[Verse 57]
I don't ever think I've- some money, some- little talent
These rappers' shows look like lip-sync battles with Jimmy Fallon
What really happened? I'm jealous if people selling platinum
Worst year of my life? That's like saying the worst Kendrick album;
It's way better than average, I'm already established
Unforgettable classic, y'all shit is set to go plastic
They want to see me disappear like incredible magic
Your regrettable attitude is upsetting my passion
I'm getting listens and play, fuck all the simpler days
I just took a moo- mon- break- I got Spotify paying me minimum wage
I'm like that's good enough, man, I've been eating, ain't full enough, I just want to make it pulling up
I've been putting up with all of these amateurs, sure enough, I'ma show 'em how it should be done

[Verse 58]
I got green and I want beef like a omnivore
I got that exclusive flow that can't be bought at stores-
All this new shit, they still be wanting more
They say that my duty is not fair like some modern war
I'm stacking rolls, just like the Michelin Man
Eating sushi every night, but I don't live in Japan
Damn, I'm trying to get as many hits as I can
And like a lazy-ass beaver, I ain't giving a damn
Woah, this shit is corny, you really gonna ignore me?
You really gon' let it slide when these Benjamins do adore me?
And as we rise, man, it ain't about fame and fortune
We got a greater importance, that's why I wake in the morning
I'm tryna play a performance- make a change with a chorus
I came from a tiny platform, but now my stage is enormous
Flawless, do anything to stay out of office
'Cause I'm cautious, not gonna sell my soul for the profits

[Verse 59]
Yeah, I got many dreams, lot of passions
I'ma get there by any means, just imagine
Just know that anything can happen
Take chances, put everything in rapping
I don't even really need to go fast
Flow back, not wandering like a nomad
So glad, yeah, they all melt like a snowman
Back-to-back flames got Drake sayin', ""Oh, man""
Not again, got a lotta friends who wanna end
All my shit, unsubscribe like I'm On Demand
I've been living in a moment, got a lot of fans
Pedophile back at it again with the white vans
Can't lie, man, I got a lot of white fans
Could I get a ultralight beam, maybe by chance?
Every day I've been switching up on my stance
Scare everyone away whenever I dance
People in the comments saying that I can't rap
Okay, 'cause I didn't understand that
Fuck you, man, I think it's time to stand back
You'll be sittin', gettin' in the way like a sandbag
If you want to talk trash, say it to my face
I'll be singin', ""La-la"", I got two LA's-
I be laughin', ""Haha"" at the human race
Hey, I'm in the lead, not far from a newer place
Uh- gettin' sick and sicker
The flow on the track gettin' quicker and quicker
Shiver me timbers, I'm winnin' these bigger
Killer victor, not swipin' left like it's Tinder
They filter my picture, put it in bad light-
Uh, me playin' these rappers is a bad fight
Ayy, me spittin' these bars, that's a mad sight
Haters be changin' their opinions, is that right?
Ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm winnin'- I'm winnin'- I'm spittin' a million words per the minute
I'm in it to win it, I'm in it to win it, I'm fixin' to hit it, uh
This shit is my mission, not up to your opinions
You know that I'm grinnin', ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 60]
But I don't wanna be a ribbon in the sky
Livin' in disguise, man, I see the venom in the middle of their eyes
Figure if you're livin' or you die
'Cause it's time for you to finish your reply
I've been dealin' with these guys, know that I ain't black and I rap
So I guess I'm automatically wack, when, matter of fact
I am better than like half of these actors
Outdated, like a battery pack that a Blackberry has
On the back of its tab
-Rapping has the wrath of attack to send a missile back to Iraq
Then leave a crack on the map
And put my train of thought right back on the track, oh
All these rappers out of breath
-That gasp like a motherfuckin' asthma attack, yeah
Match, match, match, makin' flames when I swipe right
And I ain't talkin' 'bout some crap on an app
-Blowin' up with bars like a TNT
Blowin' up: TNT, with bars: AT&T
I'm the one you may see on a screen
I won't be passin' out like, ""Hey! Is he on lean?""
Nah, I ain't about that
The music that I make is a motherfuckin' soundtrack
To the dopest life, Big Sean better bounce back
Everybody tryna raise the stakes? Well, they better take it out back
I got a lot on my mind, I cannot go behind
Uh, ayy, ayy, ayy
I just deleted the- all those lyrics
But that don't matter, 'cause I'm sayin' them in spirit, bitch, uh!

[Verse 61]
Who would'a, who would'a thought
That Quadeca woulda moved to the top? I've been doin' a lot, ayy
See me for the music I make
Not the views, not the shoes that I bought
I mean who would'a thought that I'd go up, up and away?
5K to 100K in a month how I play
'Fucker think he runnin' the game
See these haters, now they runnin' away 'cause I've come here to stay
Comin' from the jump in L.A.‚Äã
But a boy been comin' up in the Bay, where they utter my name
Man, I'm like, ""What-what do I say
To a friend who think we one in the same?"" 'Cause I'm done with the games
Sayin' ""This is fuckin' insane""
Wanted bars, well, no one can complain, yeah, they lovin' the claims
I got an abundance of pain
When I drop it, it just bust into flames, it just bust into-
Yeah

[Hook 18]
Who would'a, who would'a thought
That a motherfucker'd hop on UK vibe like I'm Drake?
Ayy, who would'a thought
I'd be spittin' all these syllables without makin' a single mistake?

[Verse 62]
But, I've actually- I've actually made a lot of mistakes, ooh, ooh
I've made a- made a lot of mistakes, ooh
I'm so big, I make hippopotamus shake, ooh
That's-that's really bad, ayy

[Interlude 20]
Uh
Got to drink some water, it's great
Got a lot on my plate... uh
Damn

[Verse 63]
This is the third time we're on this beat
I do this beat like twenty times
But that's okay, 'cause you know I got so many rhymes
You know what? On this one, I'ma just freestyle, uh
Uh, I got all your bitches on my speed dial
Ayy, and you sittin' there, meanwhile
I'm doing all this shit, I got it like it's a free trial
Free trial, I ain't spending no money
Now everybody lookin' at me, say I'm so funny
But not in a way where they're laughin' with me
Now they're laughin' at me, man, they so silly
They so- they like BILLY by Tekashi
Now everybody, you know that they wanna stop me
But they not gon' stop me 'cause I'm not gon' let them
And now, everybody, you know that I want to get up
Into the best place, into the best place
Now everybody, I be writin' all my essays
I write my music like a motherfuckin' essay
'Cause who else is doin' hu- a hundred-sixty pages on a damn song?
Uh, 'cause I'm makin' this so damn long
People lookin' at me, need a blood- motherfuckin' tampon
Yeah, 'cause he's so borin' now
Everybody, man, you know I'm makin' goals, I'm scorin' now
I'm pourin' now, all your shit is trash, I'm pourin' out
Pourin' it in-into the garbage 'cause you know I'm snorin' now
You guys are tirin', see, you are so tirin'
I'm doing all this shit, I'm killin' shit, man, I am violent
Ayy, I got the strings like a violin
People lookin' at me, they like how the fuck I'm rhymin' this
I don't even know, this is off the top now
Got a lot of bitches, but I'm never gonna stop now
This is it what I gotta do, I'ma do it now!
Fuck all of these bitches, I make music now
Uh, they be like, ""Who's makin' that stupid sound?""
I'm like ""That's me, bitch! That's me, bitch""
I got all these people, see me on a f- tree, bitch
This a treat, bitch, this ain't remixed
I got people lookin' at me now, they wanna be me, they wanna be this
But they can't, they gon' get this
Lookin' at you, I'ma shoot my shots, you better get hit
Ayy, 'cause you know I'm 'bout to get lit
Everybody, you know that I'm doin' this the best-est
The best-est in the nation
Everybody, [?] take me to the station
Best in the nation, might go on a vacation
Look at all these people: ""Uh-uh-uh-uh...""; hesitation
And I'm elevatin', got a reservate in
Ayy, all you motherfuckers waitin', but I am demonstratin'
Demonstratin' what I gotta do now
Ooh, you know that I'm movin' right through now
People lookin' at me, I'm like ""Who? How?""
I don't know, I'm just askin' a bunch of questions now
Uh, but I'm never gonna let it down
Never gonna set it down, I am like the best in town
Ayy, ayy, this is freestyled
Uh, I'm not gon' rap some more freestyle
I do it off the top of the dome, uh
Tell you all the styles that you wantin' to know
I'm might talk in gibberish, you know that I'm ridiculous
These people givin' presence like my name is Saint Nicholas
Ooh, ooh, and I'm licorice
I'm sweet, I got people, but you I'm gonna figure this out
Better figure this, put in a top, now
Ooh, but you know I'm never gonna stop now
Uh, uh, this is Hamlet
Damn, you'd be lookin' like a damn pig
You be lookin' like a damn ""Oink, oink"", bitch
I got all these people, man, you know you so annoyin'
No annoyin', I don't really even know now

[Verse 63]
Uh, you know that I'm never gonna slow down
They know me now, but don't know my sound, it is so profound
But give me two years and I'll make it, let me show you how

[Verse 64]
I got the sunglasses, put it on my sun tan
Uh, you know that I'm doing this how I can
Uh, you know I'm gonna get a sunburn
I done seen a lot of shit I wish I could unlearn
Uh, yeah, I wish that I could unsee
Uh, Playboy, Playboy bunny
Uh, dropping this, I make a lot of money
All these haters laughing, 'cause they think that shit is funny
But it ain't, but it ain't, 'cause I'm serious
When I'm doing shit, I'm getting drunk, I get delirious
Uh but you know I do it sober
I got all this water, got a four-leaf clover
Little bitch, 'cause I'm lucky, I got a lot of good luck
Uh, I said, ""Bye, have a good f-""
I don't know, I don't know
Now I gotta eat some good lunch
Lunch- I be sittin' in a lunch line
All these bitches like me, now they stealing all my punchlines
Ayy, and you know I make some rhymes
And you know I do this shit, got a drumline
Drumline, like I'm doing this on a TV show
Now you see me, I'm like C-3PO
Uh, 'cause I'm livin' in my star wars
People lookin' at me, but you know I gotta- start more
Start more when I'm playin' on a pitch
People lookin' at me now, they see me, I'm on Twitch
But I ain't on Twitch, I only streamed like one- or twice
People lookin' at me, now I'm not so nice
I'm not so nice, but you know that I eat lots of rice
And I burn that Rice too when I make a diss track
This diss, this that, making diss tracks
Uh, now you better make some Big Macs
Ooh, now I- don't have a six-pack
'Cause, I'm kind of lanky, but whatever, fuck that
Fuck that, I don't really even care now
Ooh, now you better get your hair out
Grow my hair out, grow a beard out
People lookin' at me, they know I'm makin' parodies like Weird Al
Uh, but you know I got a weird owl
Like I am- who's the guy with the owl?
Fuck! What's his name? In Harry Potter, though
Just tell me what I want to know
Hagrid! They call me Hagrid
I got Hamlet, now you know that you a bad bitch
When I walk in here as soon as I establish
People know I'm makin' this appear, like it's magic
Ayy, your life story is so tragic
Uh, better keep your mixtape in the attic
Uh, I calculate this shit like mathematics
Uh, now you know that that's past it
I'm past it, I'm past it, I'm movin' to the future
Uh, and I'm doin' what I'm used to
I'm used to this like Future and Drake
Uh, uh, now, who's-who am I gonna thank?
Who am I thankin', like at Thanksgiving
Uh, uh, you know I am great and I keep givin'
Keep givin', keep givin' on a track now
Track now, never back down
Doin' this till I passed out, till I black out
I got people looking at me, I take the trash out
Everybody, man, you know I'm makin' that sound
Make a loud sound, make a loud sound goin' downtown
Ooh, all my music is surround sound
You hear it everywhere you go, spin around now
People lookin' at me, now they never want to drown now
All your music gets drowned out in a conversation
I got these people see a star, I'm in the constellation
And you know I compile it in a compilation
Everybody, man, you know that I be livin', ah-ma-raisin
Uh, ah, uh, I don't- didn't even say a real word there
Didn't say a real word
You a real nerd, I'll be flying like a real bird
Got these bitches lookin' at me, how'd that feel? Word up!
Uh, word up, it's just like fucking nineties
People looking at me, but they never gonna find me
Like Tekashi, you better come test my gangster
People lookin' at me, but never gonna thank ya
Actually, don't test my gangster, 'cause I don't claim to be one
People lookin' at me, and I'm great, and they see ones
See fun, see ma- I just see more
Uh, yeah, your name is Seymour
Your dad's name is Seymour
I was doin' this shit, like way before
I was on tour, because I just had to take a detour
Uh, and you know that I des-
Destroy, destroy
Who are you? But I'm me, boy, but I'm- uh, me-me, boy
I don't do this shit, I just do this shit
All these rappers, man, you know that I am ludicrous
And I'm movin' bricks to the top of the charts
People lookin' at me, and you know that I'm not gonna start
I'm always gonna do it, 'cause I'm never gonna stop
People lookin' at me, now I'm sendin' all these shots
To the top of your dome, hit you, whip 'em in the dome now
Uh, and your bars, they get thrown out
And you know that I be doing this, I'm goin' down
Uh, but I'm goin' up, you goin' down!
I had to re- had to- had to do a re-phrase
You know how I had a great day
Uh, I might pull up wit' an AK
Uh, and you know I'm gonna make a great plate
Great plate, great escape, I lost my style
I lost my style.. okay
That was a- actually a pretty good freestyle, damn
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 65]
-Money on the run, that's running business
-Do this shit for fun? That's some decision
Coming in this, I wondered, ""Is this a road that they'll be fucking with?""
They loving it, making paper, like Dunder Mifflin
Still got haters and doubters I keep on running into
-Got a problem? Hop on the track, I'd love to diss you
People hate on successes, you got some fucking issues
Like- damn, need me to get you another tissue?
Just please don't go- come back, no one'll miss you
Well, I won't, I'll shrug my shoulders and just continue
On my mission, encountered a lot of villains
I'm kicking them down repeatedly lyrically, like it's some Jujitsu

[Verse 66]
Uh, damn
You know that I am the fucking man
Uh, I'ma make this money, make a hundred grand
I don't really think that you'll understand
Understand, 'cause I'm back again
A fan again, I'm going to war, like Afghanistan
What's the plan?
The plan- the plan, man, to plan man?
I'ma do the shit, I'ma do the same thing
I'ma do this shit goin' on my campaign
Celebratin' every day, I'm drinkin' champagne
Ooh, and you're gonna know my damn name
Gonna know my last name, now they see me in the rap game
Uh, they look at me like, ""How that changed""
But- t-truly nothing even changed, though
Uh, all these rappers got the same flow
So it's good to evolve, like Play-Doh
'Cause I get molded, I get molded every day, bro
Every day, bro, but I ain't Jake Paul
Sliding into home base with your bitch; baseball
Hey! And now, you're gonna go fall
Uh, but you know I'm gonna go far
I might go in Mario Kart in a go-kart
I got people, now you know I'm goin' so far
So far, but I'm never gonna backtrack
I got all these people send me pics on the Snapchat
But I don't even use Snapchat
People lookin' at me, I might move that back
To the past rap, I be doin' mad facts
All my math facts in my math class, I got backpacks
On my back-back, bag-bag it up
I got all this money, now I stack-stack it up
Oh, ayy, freestylin's pretty fun, though
To be honest, you be lookin' like a dumbo
Oh, oh, who's the winner, bitch?
You already know who won, bro!
That's-that's a horrible bar, bitch
Bar, bitch in my car, bitch
I just do this shit, I'll do this shit like an Arby's, Ar- bitch
I don't know, I just do this shit, uh
And you know that I am too legit, uh

[Verse 67]
Well, who has ever flown like this?
The only kid who's so legit and going in
They focusing, they noticing, they know it's him
Got doors I be opening
Uh- game like some Yeezy's, I've just broken in
They all convinced that I ain't supposed to win
Now my flow's like water, 'cause it's soaking in
They won't go swim, more salty than a ocean is
I'm floatin' in-

[Verse 68]
Seen as automatically wack, uh
Like an asthma attack, havin' ass in the back of your class
But you know that I don't give a motherfuckin' half of a crap
Matter of fact
I ain't never gon' be packin' my bags, and that's a wrap

[Verse 69]
People lookin' at me, now they likin' how I rap, uh
Rap, rap, rap, rap, rap song
People looking at me, know my rap is that long
It's too long, too long, might make a few songs, uh
I be gettin' bread like a crou-crouton
Cuttin' out my paper like a coupon
Uh, might rate it like Groupon
Get your group on, jget your raps on
People looking at me, now I make a rap song
Uh, uh, when I'm with your girl, I last long
That's a fact, bitch, better put it up and fact
That's a fact, better put it up in stone writin'
People lookin' at me, they be like ""I don't like it""
Well, that's too bad, I might have to go bike you
Off to the ship because, to be honest, man, I don't like you
Don't like you and that is the true shit
Uh, now you lookin' like a U, bitch
Rubik's Cube, but I ain't Logic
Uh, uh, don't do this shit for the profits
Let's be honest, I gon' make a promise
Uh, now you know that I be on this
Old advertisement, phone service, Vonage
Bon voyage, bitch, I'm on this
Uh, uh, got a Hamlet
Shakespeare, but you know you're glad that I came here
Uh, and I'll be doing this, got a great ear
I'm just listenin' to this shit, you know that it's so clear
So clear 'cause you know all of y'all not here

Uh, uh, Rosencrantz
Yeah, you know I do my dance
Do my dance, got the newest shit, got the newest pants, newest plans
Everybod,y you know who I am, who I am
And that's a fact, uh
Turn on in my vid and then react, ooh
Turn on my vid, then react
""Oh my God, he's so lit!"" That's a fact
Now, they see me on the map, ooh, ooh
See me on my stats, almanac, ooh, ooh
Now they want to get it back
But they never get it back, see me, I'm settin' you back
Like eighty-five years, that's a fact
I don't know why I said that
But let's get back to the main shit, uh
Now, they see me on the playlist
Main, now I'm makin' hits, they sayin' that I'm dangerous
Now, they be comin' when I'm playin' this
Playin' this in a- in a car, though
Now, you're lookin' like a weirdo
Now you know that, I'm here, though
Uh, I ain't drinkin' no beer, though
I'm growing out my beard, so
Long, but you can't even see it
Me, now you wouldn't want to be it
I don't make fuckin'- fuckin' remix
I don't, I may use another beat, but I make it my own
Now, everybody, I am takin' my throne, stayin' alone
Now you know that I just stay in my zone
I got all these people, now you know I'm makin' it home
I'm makin' it back home, I'm makin' it back home
Now, everybody, you look like a fat gnome
Killer Keemstar, Killer Keemstar
Now you know I got three stars, I play guitar
Play keytar on my keyboard, ayy
Now you know I better get a reward
Uh, you ain't never seen me before
On the track, but I had to take a detour
Uh, now we're waitin' for the breakdown
People lookin' at me, but I'm never gonna shake now
You ju- tryna get all of my vids down and take down
Uh, fuck you and your plate now
Uh, I'm makin' plays now
I make a great sound
Make a lot of pounds
Make a lot of pounds
Make-ma-ma-ma-
Make a-make a-make a-make a lot of pounds
Your career is done, it found it in the lost and found
Damn, that could have been sick if I'd delivered it
People lookin' at me, now they really want to figure this
I'm makin' millions, but I am not a Brazilian
You know I'm skillin' it, everybody know I'm killin', that I'm killin' shit
I'm killin' shit, but I am a murderer
I ain't a murderer, I ain't a murder, see
I murder shit, do this shit to, like, the third degree
And now people lookin' at me, they ain't heard of me
But to be honest, man, I even heard of you
Uh, people lookin' at me, I ain't gon' murder you
Uh, the only thing I murder is this beat
People lookin' at me, now they turn it on and see
Now they turn it on and hear it, now they know I got the spirits
And they listen to my shit, now they likin' all my lyrics, oh
Ayy, now I'm readin' all this Shakespeare
Ayy, aren't you glad that I came here?
Ayy, how to do thirty-thousand words on it
Ayy, now you know that you're the worst on it
When you get up on a track, all your shit is fuckin' trash
Now I'm gonna leave you in the fuckin' pass
I'm the fuckin' man, now do you understand?
People lookin' at me, I'ma make a hundred grand
Make a hundred grand, this is what I fuckin' planned
Ayy, now you know that I'm the fuckin' man
Uh, when I am rappin', I got like twenty styles
Now you know I've run a many miles
Ran many miles, ran many miles
That you know that I got many styles, I got plenty dials
On my telephone, telephone, better left alone
People lookin' at me, now I'm gonna send you home
You a metronome, I can do this shit with no metronome
Uh, now you know I don't get at home
I don't do this shit, but I do it a lot
People, you know that I'm doin' it, I'm movin' my thoughts
I'm movin' my thoughts, get lost in my thoughts, get lost when I talk
Do a freestyle, but it's costin' a lot
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, doin' this beat
People, they lookin' at me, then they see me on the street
Oh, oh, oh, I ain't who you gonna beat now

I got a money flow, are you feelin' rich?
Damn, too lit
People know they ask me how I do this

Lookin' at you, you look like a rhino
You look like a rhino with a horn in your head

Now I'm rappin' on this beat, but you know this ain't no remix
This ain't no remix, I do this shit for free, bitch
Now I'm spazzin' on the mic
I be spazzin' on the mic, literally
Now you know I'm so holy, I'm so biblically
I do this biblically, I am the literal me
People, they lookin' to do this shit figuratively
But I do it for real, I do it for real
People lookin' at me, now they're always tryna think how I feel
But I don't feel shit, I don't feel shit
Motherfucker, you know this some real shit
Hey, hey, uh, you know I got the formula
Uh, and you know that I'm just warmin' up
I could do this shit for eight more hours
People lookin' at me, you need to take more showers
'Cause you dirty, dirty, better get them hours back
Uh, now you better need a shower cap
Or this rain gon' hit you in the head, though
Uh, better put on some new headphones
I just realized I'm talkin' really loudly
These headphones were turnin' really fuckin' loud, see
Uh, but you know they so proud of me
Every single day, I got these haters, they be doubtin' me
But now, they happy to see me 'cause I be winnin' now
People lookin' at me, now you know that I be spinnin' 'round

Now you know that I'm doin' this shit I'm gettin' paper
Gettin' paper, now I'm get 'em haters

Throwin' up, now I'm gettin' older
World's tough, man, it's gettin' colder

Like a huge rock, uh, ayy, hey
Like a huge rock
Not gonna say what I'd said, you probably could'a guessed it
Uh, now you know I send a message
Uh, I am so done, I ain't textin'
We gonna finish this track, finish it up
People lookin' at me, now they picturin' us
In a future with a future camera
On the track, man, I got the most stamina
Uh, uh, uh, Canal, Panama
I am true, though, bitch, I'm from Canada
Ayy, ayy, now I'm standin' up
I get my bands, get my bands, now my bands are up, uh
Like SOB x RBE
Uh, Bodak Yellow, call me Cardi B
Uh, I'm done now
30K words, now we're done now
Holy shit, that was 30K
Damn, that was a wordy day
That was a wordy time if you listened to the whole song
I love you long time, for so long
Seriously, if you actually did that
I'ma send you a Kit Kat

[Outro]
I'ma send you a Kit Kat to your home
So you can eat it
And then enjoy it, 'cause it's a Kit Kat and Kit Kats
Are candy
Alright, this is the most mentally-exhausting
Mentally-draining thing I've ever done
But it was pretty fun, it was pretty fun
I'm still rhymin' when I'm not even tryin' to
They say, ""How you, uh, rhyme when you ain't tryin' to?""
I don't know
That's just what I'd like to do
That's just what I like to do, you know?
I'm just gonna end this shit now, so, uh
If you enjoyed it, drop a like and subscribe
Uh, you know that is what I try to advise
Put it in vision to your vision, get a knife to your eye
Put an incision to your vision, get a knife to your eye
Oh, the beat just ended conveniently!
Great, the beat just ended conveniently, hahaha
I'm s- not strict, I do my lyrics leniently
So, I guess I'll be seein' you, and you'll be seein' me
Leave a like and subscribe to me

I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous

You were talking deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth

Drift ahead like they're gonna come save me
Oh, lately you've been quiet
Is there something on your mind, baby?

Cause I ain't got the time to be waiting around
Come on, tell me what you're feeling, use your mouth
If you wanna say something, say it now

Without doubt, what's going on baby?

Far behind and it's driving me crazy

Nice to meet you, where you been?

Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy

I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm

Can make a heart open

I've had more than my share

And getting nowhere, nowhere

It's been so long since
I've touched your wanting hand
I'll put my love on the line
Yes I hope you'll understand

So, baby if you want me
You've got to show me love
Words are so easy to say, but
You've got to show me love
But, you've got to show me love

I'm tired of getting caught up
In those one night affairs
What I need is somebody who will always be there

Don't you promise me the world

That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was you
Holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go

He could be your preacher, when your soul is down
He could be your lawyer on a witness stand but
He'll never love you like I can, can
He could be a stranger, given the circumstance
He could be a trophy, of a one night stand
He could have your humour, I don't understand but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

Mine is the heart, the soul for your soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can

Baby he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be a silence in this mayhem, but then again

Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated
For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in

[Chorus]
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hopin'
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love
Waiting for love to come around

[Instrumental Break]

We are one of a kind, irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical?
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated

I used to be so happy, but without you here I feel so low
I watched you as you left, but I can never seem to let you go
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's buried deep inside me, but I feel there's somethin' you should know

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
I will never forget you
You will always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart, I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die

[Post-Chorus: Zara Larsson]
'Til the day I die
'Til the day I die
'Til the day I die

[Verse 2: MNEK]
Funny how we both end up here, but everything seems so right
I wonder what would happen if we went back and put up a fight
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
So, what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind? (Take you off my mind)

I will never forget you
You will always be by my side (Be by my side)
From the day that I met you (Day I met you)
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart, I will always be sure (Be sure)
I will never forget you (Never forget you)
And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die

[Bridge: Zara Larsson & MNEK]
Feelin' it, lovin' it, everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had somethin' special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
But I'm still tied and I can't hide my connection with you
Feelin' it, lovin' it, everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
I can't hide my connection with you

[Chorus: Zara Larsson & MNEK, MNEK]
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side (You will always be my)
From the day that I met you (Day that I met you)
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart, I will always be sure (In my heart, I will be sure)
That I will never forget you (Never forget you)
And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die
[Outro: Zara Larsson, MNEK, Both]
Die, yeah

Oh yeah, yeah, oh
'Til the day I die, 'til the day I die, 'til the day I die

Never Forget You Lyrics[Verse 1: MNEK]
You and me go way back
I can't believe it's been that long
When I look at you, it's like yesterday
I'm still the same guy, but you're so strong

You can have all my money
All my time, all my pride
I'd give it all for you, I'd give it all for you

And I know you're not blind
You saw me at my worst, but you loved me at my best
And even if we never meet again
I know I'll never forget you

771,Don't Be so Hard on Yourself,Jess Glynne,I Cry When I Laugh,61,"30 ContributorsDon‚Äôt Be So Hard on Yourself Lyrics[Verse 1]
I came here with a broken heart that no one else could see
I drew a smile on my face to paper over me
But wounds heal when tears dry and cracks they don't show
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go back to simplicity
I feel like I've been missing me
Was not who I'm supposed to be
I felt this darkness over me
We all get there eventually
I never knew where I belonged
But I was right and you were wrong
Been telling myself all along

[Chorus]
Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
You might also like[Verse 2]
I'm standin' on top of the world, right where I wanna be
So how can this dark cloud keep raining over me?
But hearts break and hell's a place that everyone knows
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go back to simplicity
I feel like I've been missing me
Was not who I'm supposed to be
I felt this darkness over me
We all get there eventually
I never knew where I belonged
But I was right and you were wrong
Been telling myself all along

[Chorus]
Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, I
I learned to wave goodbye
How not to see my life
Through someone else's eyes
It's not an easy road
But now I'm not alone
So I, I won't be so hard on myself no more

[Chorus]
Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

[Outro]
'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no25Embed","Lyrics not found.

And I got an engine full of trunk space
I get money three ways, fuckin' bitches three ways
Seven different foreigns, plus she's no habl√©
But I make that bitch walk for some cheesecake (Cheesecake)
Yeah, I'm the coldest nigga, icy
Lookin' in the mirror like I wish I can be me
She too into me, I'm more into money
My hobby's her body, that pussy's my lobby
I'ma eat it (Eat it), I'ma eat it (Eat it)

She worried 'bout me, her nigga worried 'bout cuffin'

I've been spinnin' now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sippin' on red wine
I've been sittin' here for ages
Rippin' out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?

Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream

We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

[Verse 2]
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, well, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

[Bridge]
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

[Chorus]
Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, well, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

[Outro]
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on 6th Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone

Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, ""Keep our business on the low-low""
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five

And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
